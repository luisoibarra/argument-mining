For	O
example	O
,	O
if	B-Premise-supports--2
someone	I-Premise-supports--2
tells	I-Premise-supports--2
a	I-Premise-supports--2
kid	I-Premise-supports--2
that	I-Premise-supports--2
something	I-Premise-supports--2

wrong	I-Premise-supports--2

they	I-Premise-supports--2
should	I-Premise-supports--2
n't	I-Premise-supports--2
do	I-Premise-supports--2
it	I-Premise-supports--2
,	I-Premise-supports--2
but	I-Premise-supports--2
his	I-Premise-supports--2
father	I-Premise-supports--2
told	I-Premise-supports--2
him/her	I-Premise-supports--2
that	I-Premise-supports--2
it	I-Premise-supports--2
was	I-Premise-supports--2
right	I-Premise-supports--2

the	I-Premise-supports--2
kid	I-Premise-supports--2
will	I-Premise-supports--2
listen	I-Premise-supports--2
to	I-Premise-supports--2
the	I-Premise-supports--2
father	I-Premise-supports--2
instead	I-Premise-supports--2

their	B-Claim-supports--6-supports-5

They	B-Premise-supports--1

Lastly	O

children	B-Claim-attacks--8-attacks-3
