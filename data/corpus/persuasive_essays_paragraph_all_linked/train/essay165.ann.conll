conclusion	O

I	O

the	B-Claim-supports--11-supports-1

what	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
activities	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
they	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
should	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
do	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
at	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
the	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
time	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
and	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
have	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
good	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
management	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
for	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1
their	I-Claim-supports--11-supports-1

that	O

attending	B-MajorClaim
