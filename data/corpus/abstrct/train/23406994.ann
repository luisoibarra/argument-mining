T1	Claim 1674 1775	A combination regimen of MA and thalidomide is more effective than MA alone in the treatment of CACS.
T2	Premise 1611 1673	Toxicity was found to be relatively negligible in both groups.
T3	Premise 639 1018	Analysis of the trial group demonstrated a significant increase from baseline in body weight (<0.01), quality of life (p = 0.02), appetite (p = 0.01), and grip strength (p = 0.01), and a significant decrease in fatigue, Glasgow Prognostic Score (p = 0.05), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (p = 0.03), IL-6 (p < 0.01), and tumor necrosis factor-α (p = 0.02).
T4	Premise 1019 1165	In contrast, in the control group, endpoints with a significant improvement from baseline included body weight (p < 0.02) and appetite (p = 0.02).
T5	Premise 1166 1610	The mean changes in the endpoints from baseline in the trial group were significantly greater compared with the control group: in the primary endpoints, body weight (p = 0.05), fatigue (p < 0.01) and quality of life (p = 0.01), and in the secondary endpoints, grip strength (p = 0.05), Glasgow Prognostic Score (p = 0.02), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (p = 0.02), IL-6 (p < 0.01) and tumor necrosis factor-α (p = 0.01).
