T1	Premise 989 1175	At a median follow-up of 3.9 years, the estimated 4-year recurrence-free survival rate was 67.5% with the 16-week regimen versus 62.7% with CAF (P = .19, two-sided; P = .095, one-sided).
T2	Premise 1176 1309	The estimated 4-year survival rate was 78.1% with the 16-week regimen versus 71.4% with CAF (P = .10, two-sided; P = .05, one-sided).
T3	Premise 1310 1444	CAF produced significantly higher grades of leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia, as well as liver and cardiac toxicity,
T4	Premise 1453 1592	the 16-week regimen produced significantly higher grades of anemia, nausea, stomatitis, and weight loss, as well as skin and neurotoxicity.
T5	Premise 1593 1643	There were three treatment-related deaths with CAF
T6	Premise 1644 1678	but none with the 16-week regimen.
T7	Premise 1679 1775	During treatment, quality of life declined significantly more with the 16-week regimen than CAF,
T8	Premise 1776 1831	but by 4 months posttreatment, there was no difference.
T9	Premise 1832 1993	The 16-week regimen produced marginally better breast cancer outcomes than CAF with similar toxicity but a greater reduction in during-treatment quality of life.
T11	Claim 1994 2177	The 16-week regimen should not be used instead of a standard-dose regimen without careful consideration of the 16-week regimen's pros and cons, which include its complicated schedule.
T12	Claim 2178 2219	It should probably not be tested further,
T13	Claim 2220 2361	but its antimetabolite schedules and frequent drug administration (ie, dose density) should be considered in the development of new regimens.
