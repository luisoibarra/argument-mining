T1	Premise 1 226	In a multinational trial of anaemic patients with cancer receiving nonplatinum-containing chemotherapy, epoetin-alfa effectively increased haemoglobin levels, reduced red blood cell transfusion requirements, and improved QOL.
T2	Premise 296 414	a survival trend was noted favouring epoetin-alfa compared with placebo (median survival 17 vs 11 months [p = 0.126]).
T3	Premise 1352 1605	The ICUR for epoetin-alfa treatment was pounds 8,851 per QALY, with a 99% probability of a positive net benefit in QALYs (net benefit = 0.4805 years of perfect life) and a 94% probability of being acceptable using a threshold ICUR of pounds 30,000/QALY.
T4	Premise 1606 1735	The main cost drivers distinguishing epoetin-alfa from placebo were the costs of drug and patient care due to increased survival.
T5	Claim 1736 1944	The available data suggest a high probability of favourable cost-utility outcomes with epoetin-alfa treatment for anaemia in patients with stage IV breast cancer receiving nonplatinum-containing chemotherapy.
T6	Claim 1945 1978	Additional studies are warranted.
