T1	Claim 1 152	For patients with metastatic prostate cancer, treatment is primarily palliative, relying mainly on the suppression of systemic androgen hormone levels.
T2	Premise 1171 1510	Cross-sectional analyses (corrected for multiple testing) identified statistically significant differences that favored orchiectomy plus placebo for two of the five primary QOL parameters as follows: patients receiving flutamide reported more diarrhea at 3 months (P = .001) and worse emotional functioning at 3 and 6 months (both P<.003).
T3	Premise 1511 1559	Longitudinal analyses replicated these findings.
T4	Premise 1560 1625	Other analyzed QOL parameters favored the group receiving placebo
T5	Premise 1626 1703	but were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing.
T6	Claim 1704 1923	We found a consistent pattern of better QOL outcomes at each follow-up assessment during the first 6 months of treatment for orchiectomized patients with metastatic prostate cancer who received placebo versus flutamide.
T7	Claim 1924 2026	Improvement over time was evident in both treatment groups but more so for patients receiving placebo.
