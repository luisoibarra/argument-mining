T1	Claim 1 152	Facial hirsutism is one of the characteristic features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and this can lead to high levels of depression and anxiety.
T2	Premise 838 1036	Self-reported severity of facial hair in the intervention group (n = 51) fell from 7.3 to 3.6 over the 6-month study period; for the control group (n = 37) the corresponding scores were 7.1 and 6.1.
T3	Premise 1037 1136	The change was significantly greater in the intervention group [ancova F((1,83)) = 24.5, P < 0.05].
T4	Premise 1137 1315	Self-reported time spent on hair removal declined from 112 to 21 min per week in the intervention group and from 92 to 56 min in the control group [F((1,80)) = 10.2, P </= 0.05].
T5	Premise 1316 1462	Mean depression scores fell from 6.7 to 3.6 in the intervention group, compared with 6.1 to 5.4 in the control group [F((1,83)) = 14.7, P < 0.05].
T6	Premise 1463 1588	A similar change was seen for mean anxiety scores: intervention 11.1 to 8.2, control 9.6 to 9.3 [F((1,84)) = 17.8, P < 0.05].

T8	Claim 1751 1910	Laser treatment appeared to reduce the severity of facial hair and time spent on hair removal as well as alleviating depression and anxiety in women with PCOS.
T9	Claim 1911 2056	These findings suggest that ways of making this method of hair removal more widely available to women with facial hirsutism should be considered.
