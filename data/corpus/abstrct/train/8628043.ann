T1	Claim 1106 1136	Both measures were responsive;
T2	Premise 1137 1338	out of 24 changes over time, 19 were in the expected direction for the linear analogue self-assessment scale (p < or = 0.05 for 9 of 19) and 17 for the adjective checklist (p < or = 0.05 for 10 of 17).
T3	Premise 1339 1671	The linear analogue self-assessment scale was less but significantly efficient for detection of treatment effects, with relative efficiency estimates ranging from 0.16 to 2.45 and a median of 0.66 among the comparisons with relatively stable estimates (/t/ > or = 1.0) and more efficient for recurrence than the adjective checklist.
T4	Claim 1672 1886	The mood linear analogue self-assessment scale is a valid indicator of emotional well-being in patients with breast cancer in large multicenter, multicultural trials in which comprehensive scales are less feasible.
T5	Claim 1887 2053	This investigation supports the clinical relevance of linear analogue self-assessment scales as indicators of components of quality of life in cancer clinical trials.
