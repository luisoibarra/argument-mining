T1	Premise 880 1074	there was no difference in OS seen between ASA404 (n = 649) and placebo (n = 650) arms: median OS was 13.4 and 12.7 months respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.19; P = .535).
T2	Premise 1086 1188	no OS difference was seen in the histologic (squamous or nonsquamous) and sex (male or female) strata.
T3	Premise 1189 1291	Median PFS was 5.5 months in both arms (HR, 1.04; P = .727), while ORR was 25% in both arms (P = 1.0).
T4	Premise 1292 1380	Overall rate of adverse events (AEs) was comparable between the ASA404 and placebo arms.
T5	Premise 1381 1497	Grade 4 neutropenia (27% v 19%) and infusion site pain (10% v 0.5%) were reported more frequently in the ASA404 arm.
T6	Claim 1498 1642	The addition of ASA404 to carboplatin and paclitaxel, although generally well tolerated, failed to improve frontline efficacy in advanced NSCLC.
