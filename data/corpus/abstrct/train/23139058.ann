T1	Premise 794 954	There were significant (p < 0.05) interaction effects on QoL, fitness and fatigue with differences being observed between the treatment groups and the UC group.
T2	Premise 955 1009	Trends observed for the treatment groups were similar.
T3	Premise 1010 1169	The treatment groups reported improved QoL, fitness and fatigue over time and changes observed between baseline and post-intervention were clinically relevant.
T4	Premise 1170 1275	In contrast, the UC group experienced no change, or worsening QoL, fitness and fatigue, mid-intervention.
T5	Premise 1276 1349	Although improvements in the UC group occurred by 12-months post-surgery,
T6	Premise 1350 1408	the change did not meet the clinically relevant threshold.
T7	Premise 1409 1490	There were no differences in other treatment-related side effects between groups.
T8	Claim 1491 1725	This translational intervention trial, delivered either FtF or Tel, supports exercise as a form of adjuvant breast cancer therapy that can prevent declines in fitness and function during treatment and optimise recovery post-treatment.
