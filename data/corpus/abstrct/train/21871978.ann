T1	Premise 980 1083	QOL scores were increased and complication scores were improved in the postoperative periods (P < .01).
T2	Premise 1084 1174	Postoperative BMI significantly deteriorated compared with preoperative BMI in each group.
T3	Premise 1175 1335	The postoperative QOL and complication scores at 60 months after surgery were significantly better than those at 3 months after surgery in each group (P < .01).
T4	Premise 1345 1469	there was no significant difference of QOL scores and postoperative complication scores between the 2 reconstruction groups.
T5	Premise 1470 1557	The nutritional condition in the INT group was nearly the same as that in the RY group.
T6	Premise 1558 1664	Although our patient sample was small and patients who did not complete the follow-up survey were present,
T7	Claim 1665 1778	we could not identify any clinical difference between INT and RY after total gastrectomy 60 months after surgery.
T8	MajorClaim 1779 1889	The safer and simpler RY method may be a more suitable reconstruction method than INT after total gastrectomy.
