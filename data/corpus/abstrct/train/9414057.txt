 The effectiveness of a Pain Education Program in cancer patients with chronic pain offered by nurses was investigated in a randomized controlled clinical trial. A multi-method approach was used in which verbal instruction, written material, an audio cassette tape, and the use of a pain diary were combined to inform and instruct patients about pain and pain management. The Pain Education Program was tailored to the needs of the individual patient and consisted of three elements: (1) educating patients about the basic principles regarding pain and pain management; (2) instructing patients how to report their pain in a pain diary; and (3) instructing patients how to communicate about pain and how to contact health care providers. Following pretesting in 313 patients, patients who needed district nursing and who did not need district nursing at home were randomly assigned to a control or intervention group. Intervention group patients received the Pain Education Program in the hospital, and 3 and 7 days postdischarge by telephone; this was done by nurses who were specially trained as pain counselors. Follow-up assessments were at 2, 4 and 8 weeks postdischarge. Results of the pretest showed that many patients lacked knowledge about pain and pain management. The majority of pain topics had to be discussed. The Pain Education Program proved to be feasible: 75.0% of the patients had read the entire pain brochure, 55.7% had listened to the audio cassette, and 85.6% of pain scores were completed in the pain diary. Results showed a significant increase in pain knowledge in patients who received the Pain Education Program and a significant decrease in pain intensity. However, pain relief was mainly found in the intervention group patients without district nursing. It can be concluded that the tailored Pain Education Program is effective for cancer patients in chronic pain. The use of the Pain Education Program by nurses should be seriously considered on oncology units.
