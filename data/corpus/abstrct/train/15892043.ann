T1	Claim 1 172	For patients with anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast carcinoma, capecitabine plus docetaxel significantly increased overall survival compared with docetaxel alone.
T2	Premise 1000 1126	Capecitabine/docetaxel increased the median overall survival by 3 months compared with docetaxel alone (14.5 vs. 11.5 months).
T3	Premise 1127 1226	The mean quality-adjusted survival was increased by 1.8 months in the capecitabine/docetaxel group.
T4	Premise 1227 1409	The total medical-resource utilization cost per patient was 8.9% higher with the combination: 24,475 dollars for combination therapy versus 22,477 dollars for single-agent docetaxel.
T5	Premise 1410 1519	The mean cost per QALY gained with combination therapy was 13,558 dollars (standard deviation, 6742 dollars).
T6	Premise 1520 1629	Cost savings due to reduced docetaxel dose and hospital use were the major cost offsets with the combination.
T7	Premise 1630 1824	Sensitivity analyses showed that varying the mean hospital cost per day from the 5th to the 95th percentile resulted in cost-utility ratios ranging from 20,326 dollars to as low as 6360 dollars.
T8	Claim 1825 2068	Capecitabine/docetaxel was a cost-effective treatment in patients with anthracycline-pretreated advanced breast carcinoma, and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio that compares very favorably with that of many other oncology therapies.
