T1	Premise 1014 1177	Compared with standard TPN, a higher serum prealbumin level and better nitrogen balance were observed in glutamine-enriched TPN (P = 0.039 and 0.048 respectively).
T2	Premise 1178 1297	A significantly lower serum interleukin-6 level was found in comparing glutamine-enriched with standard TPN (P = 0.01),
T3	Premise 1298 1383	but not in interleukin-10 (P = 0.374) and tumor necrosis factor-Î± levels (P = 0.653).
T4	Premise 1394 1523	a significant lower serum C-reactive protein level was detected in glutamine-enriched TPN compared with standard TPN (P = 0.013).
T5	Premise 1532 1718	four cases of postoperative infectious complications were noted in the control group, but no postoperative infectious complications were observed in the interventional group (P = 0.037).
T7	Claim 1719 1902	Our present study shows that glutamine-enriched TPN may be beneficial in improving the inflammatory status and decreasing the infectious morbidity in postoperative GI cancer patients.
