T1	Claim 1 156	Treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy provides a modest survival advantage over supportive care alone in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
T2	Premise 957 1203	Superior survival was observed with the combined paclitaxel regimens (median survival time, 9.9 months; 1-year survival rate, 38.9%) compared with etoposide plus cisplatin (median survival time, 7.6 months; 1-year survival rate, 31.8%; P =. 048).
T3	Premise 1204 1296	Comparing survival for the two dose levels of paclitaxel revealed no significant difference.
T4	Premise 1297 1464	The median survival duration for the stage IIIB subgroup was 7.9 months for etoposide plus cisplatin patients versus 13.1 months for all paclitaxel patients (P =.152).
T5	Premise 1465 1611	For the stage IV subgroup, the median survival time for etoposide plus cisplatin was 7.6 months compared with 8.9 months for paclitaxel (P =.246).
T6	Premise 1612 1864	With the exceptions of increased granulocytopenia on the low-dose paclitaxel regimen and increased myalgias, neurotoxicity, and, possibly, increased treatment-related cardiac events with high-dose paclitaxel, toxicity was similar across all three arms.
T7	Premise 1865 1928	Quality of life (QOL) declined significantly over the 6 months.
T8	Claim 1938 2001	QOL scores were not significantly different among the regimens.
T9	Claim 2037 2191	paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2)) combined with cisplatin has replaced etoposide plus cisplatin as the reference regimen in our recently completed phase III trial.
