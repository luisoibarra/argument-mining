T1	Premise 1231 1486	Maintenance therapy with erlotinib did not impact on deterioration in HRQoL: TSP (hazard ratio [HR]=0.91 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.12]; n=785), TTD in TOI (HR=1.06 [95% CI 0.87-1.31]; n=781) and TTD in HRQoL (HR=0.96 [95% CI 0.79-1.16]; n=776).
T2	Premise 1487 1701	Time to pain and time to analgesic use were significantly delayed in patients receiving erlotinib compared with placebo (HR=0.61 [95% CI 0.42-0.88]; p=0.0080 and HR=0.66 [95% CI 0.46-0.94]; p=0.0199, respectively).
T3	Premise 1702 1869	A non-significant trend towards delayed time to cough and time to dyspnoea (HR=0.77 [95% CI 0.49-1.21] and HR=0.75 [95% CI 0.48-1.17], respectively) was also observed.
T4	Claim 1870 2045	Erlotinib maintenance therapy significantly extends progression-free survival without compromising patient HRQoL in comparison with placebo, with some improvement in symptoms.
