T1	Premise 994 1150	Gastrointestinal and GU toxicity persisted 5 years after RT and did not differ between the two dose schedules other than in regard to urgency of defecation.
T2	Premise 1151 1294	However, 1-month GI toxicity was not only worse in patients with the hypofractionated RT schedule but also adversely affected daily activities.
T3	Premise 1295 1390	Nadir prostate-specific antigen values occurred at a median of 18.0 (3.0-54.0) months after RT.
T4	Premise 1391 1561	A total of 76 biochemical relapses, with or without clinical relapses, have occurred since; of these, 37 were in the hypofractionated and 39 in the conventional schedule.
T6	Premise 1562 1728	The 5-year biochemical +/- clinical relapse-free and overall survival was 55.9% and 85.3% respectively for all patients, and did not differ between the two schedules.
T7	Claim 1855 1940	The hypofractionated schedule is equivalent in efficacy to the conventional schedule.
T8	Claim 1729 1854	Radiation therapy for prostate carcinoma causes persistent GI toxicity that is largely independent of the two dose schedules.
