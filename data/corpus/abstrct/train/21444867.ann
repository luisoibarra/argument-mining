T1	Premise 784 946	The 15-year actuarial locoregional recurrence rates were 5.8% for EBRT versus 15.5% for NAT (P < .001), and 15-year overall survival was 52% versus 60% (P = .14).
T2	Premise 1049 1245	Patients treated with EBRT reported significant (P < .01) and clinically relevant higher rates of urinary incontinence, diarrhea, and fecal leakage leading to more limitations in daily activities.
T3	Premise 1246 1390	Increased symptoms were reflected by the frequent use of incontinence materials after EBRT (day and night use, 42.9% v 15.2% for NAT; P < .001).
T4	Premise 1391 1525	Patients treated with EBRT reported lower scores on the SF-36 scales "physical functioning" (P = .004) and "role-physical" (P = .003).
T5	Claim 1526 1690	EBRT for endometrial cancer is associated with long-term urinary and bowel symptoms and lower physical and role-physical functioning, even 15 years after treatment.
T6	MajorClaim 1691 1819	Despite its efficacy in reducing locoregional recurrence, EBRT should be avoided in patients with low- and intermediate-risk EC.
