T1	Premise 552 677	Overall objective response (OR) rates were higher in patients treated with EXE than in those treated with MA (15.0% v 12.4%);
T2	Premise 678 757	a similar trend was noted in patients with visceral metastases (13.5% v 10.5%).
T3	Premise 758 1101	Median survival time was significantly longer with EXE (median not reached) than with MA (123.4 weeks; P =.039), as were the median duration of overall success (OR or stable disease > or = 24 weeks; 60.1 v 49.1 weeks; P =.025), time to tumor progression (20.3 v 16.6 weeks; P =.037), and time to treatment failure (16.3 v 15.7 weeks; P =.042).
T4	Premise 1102 1195	Compared with MA, there were similar or greater improvements in pain, TRSS, and QOL with EXE.
T5	Claim 1196 1227	Both drugs were well tolerated.
T6	Premise 1228 1305	Grade 3 or 4 weight changes were more common with MA (17.1% v 7.6%; P =.001).
T7	Claim 1306 1555	EXE prolongs survival time, time to tumor progression, and time to treatment failure compared with MA and offers a well-tolerated treatment option for postmenopausal women with progressive advanced breast cancer who experienced failure of tamoxifen.
