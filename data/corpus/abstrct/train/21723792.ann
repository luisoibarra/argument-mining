T1	Premise 814 951	The ORRs were 48.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.5%-59.5%) and 58.7% (95% CI, 47.9%-68.9%; P = .117) with PB and PB+G, respectively.
T2	Claim 1 132	The addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel improved progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC).
T3	Premise 952 1258	The median PFS was 8.8 months (95% CI, 8.1-10.4 months) and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.7-12.7 months; P = .247; hazard ratio, 0.82); the median OS was 25.0 months (95% CI, 18.8-not assessable [N/A] months) and 24.3 months (95% CI, 20.3-N/A months; P = .475; hazard ratio, 0.84), with PB and PB+G, respectively.
T4	Premise 1259 1354	There was significantly more grade 3-4 neutropenia (P = .001) and dyspnea (P = .014) with PB+G.
T5	Premise 1355 1618	Patients treated with PB experienced more improvement in total FACT-B (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast) (P = .021), FACT-B Social/Family Well-being (P = .041), and Breast Cancer-Additional Concerns (P = .008) scores than patients treated with PB+G.
T6	Claim 1619 1724	The addition of gemcitabine to PB was not associated with a statistically significant improvement in ORR.
T7	Claim 1725 1803	Treatment with PB+G increased the incidence of severe neutropenia and dyspnea,
T8	Claim 1804 1854	although the regimen generally was well tolerated.
