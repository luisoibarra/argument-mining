T1	Premise 1144 1187	No QOL differences were noted between arms.
T2	Premise 1188 1308	GE/G Grade 3-4 toxicities included: neutropenia (18.3%/28.2%); thrombocytopenia (14.6%/25.6%); and fatigue (11.0%/7.7%).
T3	Premise 1309 1408	No statistically significant relationships between biomarker expression and outcomes were observed.
T4	Premise 1418 1514	patients with low expression of cytoplasmic pGSK-3Î² trended toward greater OS with GE treatment.
T5	Premise 1515 1565	OS, PFS, QOL, and RR were comparable between arms.
T6	Claim 1566 1620	Adding E to G did not increase hematologic toxicities.
T8	Claim 197 264	Data suggest that the GE combination may improve clinical outcomes.
