T1	Premise 878 1010	Among the clinical outcome measures, QOL score improvement was greater for UAE with TAGMs compared with PVA (49.0 vs 27.9; P = .02),
T2	Premise 1011 1047	but no other differences were noted.
T3	Premise 1048 1496	Of the 25 patients in whom 3-month MR imaging follow-up was completed, those treated with TAGM were significantly more likely to have complete infarction of all leiomyomas (six patients vs one patient; P = .02), were more likely to have at least 90% tumor infarction (eight patients vs four patients; P = .03), and had a lower mean percent of residual perfused fibroid tumor tissue (9.6% vs 44.3%; P = .004) compared with patients treated with PVA.
T4	Claim 1593 1730	The use of spherical PVA particles in the manner described herein results in an unacceptably high rate of failed tumor infarction in UAE.
