T1	Premise 785 875	Breast IMRT significantly improved the dose distribution compared with standard radiation.
T2	Premise 876 1088	This translated into a lower proportion of patients experiencing moist desquamation during or up to 6 weeks after their radiation treatment; 31.2% with IMRT compared with 47.8% with standard treatment (P = .002).
T3	Premise 1089 1262	A multivariate analysis found the use of breast IMRT (P = .003) and smaller breast size (P < .001) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of moist desquamation.
T4	Premise 1263 1326	The use of IMRT did not correlate with pain and quality of life
T5	Claim 1458 1571	Breast IMRT significantly reduced the occurrence of moist desquamation compared with a standard wedged technique.
T6	Claim 1572 1663	Moist desquamation was correlated with increased pain and reduction in the quality of life.
T7	Premise 1332 1457	the presence of moist desquamation did significantly correlate with pain (P = .002) and a reduced quality of life (P = .003).
