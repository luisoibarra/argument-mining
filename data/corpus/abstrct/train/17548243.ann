T1	Claim 1 116	Depression, anxiety, fatigue, and impaired wellbeing are common, important, and closely related in advanced cancer.
T2	Premise 1418 1788	Sertraline had no significant effect (scale, benefit over placebo [95% CI]) on depression (CES-D 0.4 [-2.6 to 3.4]), anxiety (HADS-A 2.0 [-1.5 to 5.5]), fatigue (FACT-F 0.3 [-4.3 to 4.9]), overall quality of life (FACT-G 1.7 [-1.3 to 4.7]), or clinicians' ratings (SQLI 2.0 [-2.5 to 6.5]), and the 95% CI ruled out a clinically significant benefit for all main outcomes.
T3	Premise 1789 1897	Sertraline was discontinued more often and earlier than was placebo (hazard ratio 1.46 [1.03-2.06], p=0.03).
T4	Premise 1928 2211	the first planned interim analysis in February 2006 (n=150) showed that survival was longer in patients assigned placebo than in patients assigned sertraline (unadjusted hazard ratio 1.60 [95% CI 1.04-2.45], log-rank p=0.04; adjusted hazard ratio 1.62 [1.06-2.41], Cox model p=0.02).
T5	Premise 2212 2492	However, at the final analysis in July 2006 of all patients (n=189) and with longer follow-up, survival did not differ significantly between the treatment groups (unadjusted hazard ratio 1.35 [0.95-1.91], log-rank p=0.09; adjusted hazard ratio 1.27 [0.87-1.84], Cox model p=0.20).
T6	Claim 2576 2761	Sertraline did not improve symptoms, wellbeing, or survival in patients with advanced cancer who do not have major depression, and should be reserved for those with a proven indication.
