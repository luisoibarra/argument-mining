T1	Premise 744 911	Combination treatment in the GemCis arm was associated with a prolonged median progression-free survival (5.3 months v 3.1 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.75; P = .053).
T2	Premise 912 1042	Also, median overall survival was superior for patients treated in the GemCis arm as compared with the Gem arm (7.5 v 6.0 months),
T3	Premise 1043 1132	an advantage which did not, however, reach statistical significance (HR = 0.80; P = .15).
T4	Premise 1133 1208	Tumor response rates were comparable between treatment arms (10.2% v 8.2%).
T5	Premise 1209 1306	The rate of stable disease was, however, greater in the combination arm (60.2% v 40.2%; P < .001)
T6	Premise 1308 1384	Grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity did not exceed 15% in both treatment arms.
T7	Claim 1385 1493	These results support the efficacy and safety of an every-2-weeks treatment with gemcitabine plus cisplatin.
T8	Claim 1494 1626	Median overall survival and progression-free survival were more favorable in the combination arm as compared with gemcitabine alone,
T9	Premise 1627 1691	although the difference did not attain statistical significance.
