 To compare the outcomes of uterine artery embolization (UAE) for leiomyomas with use of tris-acryl gelatin microspheres (TAGM) versus spherical polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles. Patients undergoing UAE were randomly assigned to receive TAGMs or PVA. Embolization was performed in a standardized manner. Outcome data were collected at 3 months after embolization, including assessment of clinical symptoms, scores from a fibroid tumor-specific symptom and quality of life (QOL) questionnaire, and findings on contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including the degree of tumor infarction and volume reduction. Data were analyzed with use of t tests, the Mann-Whitney U test, and chi2 tests as appropriate. Thirty-six patients were treated. There were no differences in the two treatment groups at baseline. Clinical follow-up was obtained in 35 patients. Among the clinical outcome measures, QOL score improvement was greater for UAE with TAGMs compared with PVA (49.0 vs 27.9; P = .02), but no other differences were noted. Of the 25 patients in whom 3-month MR imaging follow-up was completed, those treated with TAGM were significantly more likely to have complete infarction of all leiomyomas (six patients vs one patient; P = .02), were more likely to have at least 90% tumor infarction (eight patients vs four patients; P = .03), and had a lower mean percent of residual perfused fibroid tumor tissue (9.6% vs 44.3%; P = .004) compared with patients treated with PVA. Based on these differences between the embolic agents, enrollment in this study was terminated. The use of spherical PVA particles in the manner described herein results in an unacceptably high rate of failed tumor infarction in UAE.
