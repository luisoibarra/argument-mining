T1	MajorClaim 1 138	For malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) patients with a poor prognosis, maintaining health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is important.
T2	Premise 971 1095	The clinical results found raltitrexed and cisplatin to be superior to cisplatin with regard to overall survival (P = .048).
T3	Premise 1096 1180	The global HRQOL scale was comparable at baseline on both treatment arms (P = .848);
T4	Premise 1181 1251	at no point was any significant difference apparent on this end point.
T5	Premise 1252 1314	Both treatments led to an improvement, over time, in dyspnoea.
T6	Claim 1315 1422	This effect is an important clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in the cisplatin/raltitrexed arm.
T7	Premise 1423 1585	However, the majority of scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 or LC13 showed stabilization of HRQOL with few clinically significant differences between the treatment arms.
T8	MajorClaim 1586 1681	This study provides important information about the HRQOL of chemotherapy-treated MPM patients.
