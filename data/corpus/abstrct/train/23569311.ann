T1	Claim 1889 1998	Combining bevacizumab with docetaxel and trastuzumab did not significantly improve investigator-assessed PFS.
T2	Premise 1725 1888	High baseline plasma vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) concentrations were associated with greater bevacizumab benefit (not statistically significant).
T3	Claim 1624 1724	Grade â‰¥ 3 febrile neutropenia and hypertension were more common with bevacizumab-containing therapy.
T4	Premise 1571 1623	The RR was 70% versus 74%, respectively (P = .3492).
T5	Premise 1203 1402	The hazard ratio for investigator-assessed PFS was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.02; P = .0775; median PFS, 13.7 v 16.5 months in the non-bevacizumab and bevacizumab arms, respectively; PFS events in 72%).
T6	Premise 1403 1570	The Independent Review Committee-assessed PFS hazard ratio was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.94; P = .0162; median PFS, 13.9 v 16.8 months, respectively; PFS events in 53%).
