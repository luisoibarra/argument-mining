T1	MajorClaim 1 139	Experimental and early clinical investigations have demonstrated encouraging results for estramustine in the treatment of malignant glioma
T2	Premise 783 823	Overall the treatment was well tolerated
T3	Premise 825 897	Mild or moderate nausea was the most common side effect of estramustine.
T5	Premise 967 1147	For astrocytoma grade III the median survival time was 10.6 (1.3-92.7) months for the radiotherapy only group and 17.3 (0.4-96.9+) months for the estramustine + radiotherapy group.
T6	Premise 1148 1261	In grade IV the corresponding median survival time was 12.3 (2.1-89.2) and 10.3 (0.3-91.7+) months, respectively.
T7	Premise 1262 1406	Median time to progress for radiotherapy only and radiotherapy and estramustin group in grade III tumours was 6.5 and 10.1 months, respectively.
T8	Premise 1407 1491	In grade IV tumours the corresponding figures were 5.1 and 3.3 months, respectively.
T9	Premise 1492 1637	Although there was a tendency for improved survival in grade III, no statistical significant differences were found between the treatment groups.
T10	Premise 1638 1767	No differences between the two treatment groups were evident with respect to quality of life according to the EORTC QLQ-protocol.
T11	Claim 1768 1922	In conclusion, this first randomized study did not demonstrate any significant improvement of using estramustine in addition to conventional radiotherapy,
T12	Claim 1923 2035	however, a trend for a positive response for the estramustine group was found in patients with grade III glioma.
