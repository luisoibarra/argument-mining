T1	Claim 1503 1563	Preliminary results suggested a positive impact on survival.
T2	Premise 726 843	There was a high rate of grade 3/4 neutropenia (97%) but not neutropenic fever (12%) during neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
T3	Premise 844 946	No significant differences in rates of acute toxicities were observed between the two arms during CRT.
T4	Premise 947 1064	Dose intensities of concurrent cisplatin, late RT toxicities and quality of life scores were comparable in both arms.
T5	Premise 1065 1210	The 3-year progression-free survival for neoadjuvant versus control arm was 88.2% and 59.5% (hazard ratio = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.20 to 1.19; P = .12).
T6	Premise 1211 1349	The 3-year overall survival for neoadjuvant versus control arm was 94.1% and 67.7% (hazard ratio = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.078 to 0.73; P = .012).
T7	Claim 1350 1502	Neoadjuvant docetaxel-cisplatin followed by CRT was well tolerated with a manageable toxicity profile that allowed subsequent delivery of full-dose CRT.
