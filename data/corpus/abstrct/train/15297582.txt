 To determine if the type of embolic material used for uterine artery embolization (UAE) for leiomyomas has an impact on short-term recovery or the effectiveness of embolization. One hundred patients were randomly assigned to undergo UAE with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles or tris-acryl gelatin microspheres. Short-term, in-hospital medication use and pain levels were recorded. After discharge, symptom severity, temperature, and medications used were recorded daily for 1 week and symptom levels were measured for weeks 2-4. Three months after embolization, contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging examinations were evaluated blindly to determine the extent of leiomyoma infarction. Symptom and quality of life (QOL) status was determined with use of questionnaires. Analysis was completed with use of chi(2) analysis, Fisher exact tests, Student t tests, and analysis of variance as appropriate. Regression analysis was used to analyze the impact on outcome of baseline factors (other than type of embolic agent). No significant differences were noted at baseline between the two treatment groups. On average, there were significantly higher volumes of tris-acryl microspheres used (9.0 mL vs 3.0 mL; P =.0001), whereas microcatheter occlusion was more common with PVA (28% vs 4%, P =.001). There were no differences in pain severity, other postprocedural symptoms, or medication use between the two treatment groups. There were also no differences in the frequency of incompletely infarcted leiomyomas, degree of improvement in symptom score, patient satisfaction, or QOL. No substantive differences were detected between outcomes of embolization with PVA particles or tris-acryl gelatin microspheres.
