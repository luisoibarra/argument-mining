 Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common complication of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been shown to be efficient in suppressing the accumulation of pleural fluid. However, whether intrapleural delivery of bevacizumab can be used to treat MPE remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined intrapleural therapy with bevacizumab and cisplatin, an antineoplastic agent, in controlling MPE. A total of 72 NSCLC study subjects with MPE were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group received intrapleural bevacizumab (300 mg) with cisplatin (30 mg) therapy and the second group received intrapleural cisplatin (30 mg) therapy alone. Pleural fluid was collected from both groups prior to and following treatment. The levels of VEGF and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the pleural fluid were determined by ELISA. In 70 evaluable study subjects, the curative efficacy in the bevacizumab group was significantly higher than that found in the cisplatin group (83.33 vs. 50.00%, respectively; p<0.05). Therapy with combined bevacizumab plus cisplatin significantly reduced VEGF levels in the pleural fluid (p<0.01). In the bevacizumab group, the levels of VEGF in the pleural fluid were significantly lower compared to those of the cisplatin group after treatment, which showed greater efficacy (p<0.01). In addition, combination therapy showed greater efficacy in the patients with high levels of VEGF expression (p<0.01). There was no significant difference in grade III/IV adverse events between the two groups. All procedures were well tolerated by the patients. Combined intrapleural therapy with bevacizumab and cisplatin was effective and safe in managing NSCLC-mediated MPE. We propose that VEGF expression levels in MPE could serve as a prognostic marker for bevacizumab therapy.
