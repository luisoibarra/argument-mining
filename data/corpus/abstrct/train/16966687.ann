T1	Claim 1 70	Most patients with advanced ovarian cancer develop recurrent disease.
T2	Claim 71 232	For those patients who recur at least 6 months after initial therapy, paclitaxel platinum has shown a modest survival advantage over platinum without paclitaxel;
T3	Premise 233 348	however, many patients develop clinically relevant neurotoxicity, frequently resulting in treatment discontinuation
T4	Premise 1140 1214	The hazard ration (HR) for PFS was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.90; P = .0031).
T5	Premise 1215 1360	Response rate was 47.2% (95% CI, 39.9% to 54.5%) for gemcitabine plus carboplatin and 30.9% (95% CI, 24.1% to 37.7%) for carboplatin (P = .0016).
T6	Premise 1361 1431	The HR for overall survival was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.75 to1.23; P = .7349).
T7	Premise 1432 1570	While myelosuppression was significantly more common in the combination, sequelae such as febrile neutropenia or infections were uncommon.
T9	Premise 1571 1662	No statistically significant differences in quality of life scores between arms were noted.
T10	Claim 1663 1833	Gemcitabine plus carboplatin significantly improves PFS and response rate without worsening quality of life for patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.

T8	Premise 955 1139	With a median follow-up of 17 months, median PFS was 8.6 months (95% CI, 7.9 to 9.7 months) for gemcitabine plus carboplatin and 5.8 months (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.1 months) for carboplatin.
