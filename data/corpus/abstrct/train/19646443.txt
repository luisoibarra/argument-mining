 Therapy for polycystic liver is invasive, expensive, and has disappointing long-term results. Treatment with somatostatin analogues slowed kidney growth in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and reduced liver and kidney volume in a PKD rodent model. We evaluated the effects of lanreotide, a somatostatin analogue, in patients with polycystic liver because of autosomal-dominant (AD) PKD or autosomal-dominant polycystic liver disease (PCLD). We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 2 tertiary referral centers. Patients with polycystic liver (n = 54) were randomly assigned to groups given lanreotide (120 mg) or placebo, administered every 28 days for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the difference in total liver volume, measured by computerized tomography at weeks 0 and 24. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Baseline characteristics were comparable for both groups, except that more patients with ADPKD were assigned to the placebo group (P = .03). The mean liver volume decreased 2.9%, from 4606 mL (95% confidence interval (CI): 547-8665) to 4471 mL (95% CI: 542-8401 mL), in patients given lanreotide. In the placebo group, the mean liver volume increased 1.6%, from 4689 mL (95% CI: 613-8765 mL) to 4895 mL (95% CI: 739-9053 mL) (P < .01). Post hoc stratification for patients with ADPKD or PCLD revealed similar changes in liver volume, with statistically significant differences in patients given lanreotide (P < .01 for both diseases). In patients with polycystic liver, 6 months of treatment with lanreotide reduces liver volume.
