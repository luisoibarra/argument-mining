T1	Premise 1367 1567	The use of prophylactic tamsulosin resulted in a statistically lower dysuria severity score (difference of 2.7 vs 4.2, P < 0.005) at 1 month, with no discernible differences at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months.
T2	Premise 1568 1622	Patients with dysuria had a statistically higher IPSS.
T3	Premise 1623 1683	The dysuria resolved faster in patients implanted with 103Pd
T5	Premise 1780 1889	In multivariate analysis, prophylactic alpha-blockers resulted in statistically lower maximum dysuria scores,
T6	Premise 1890 2026	while the maximum IPSS after implantation and isotope type (but only at 6 months) were the best predictors of the resolution of dysuria.
T7	Claim 2027 2087	Dysuria is common after brachytherapy but is typically mild.
T9	Claim 2088 2163	Prophylactic alpha-blockers gave significantly lower maximum dysuria scores
T10	Claim 2164 2221	but did not affect the time to the resolution of dysuria.
T11	Claim 2222 2309	The maximum IPSS after the implant was the best predictor of the resolution of dysuria.
