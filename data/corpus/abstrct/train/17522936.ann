T1	Premise 966 1053	There were no differences in functional outcome, morbidity, or QOL between LRP and ORP.
T2	Premise 1181 1365	The body image and cosmesis scores of female patients were significantly higher in the LRP group than in the ORP group (body image, 17.4 vs 14.9; cosmesis, 19.1 vs 13.0, respectively).
T3	Premise 1366 1483	The female patients in the ORP group had significantly lower body image scores than the male patients (14.9 vs 18.3).
T4	Claim 1484 1595	This study is the first to show that ORP has a negative impact on body image and cosmesis as compared with LRP.
T5	Claim 1596 1670	Functional outcome, QOL, and morbidity are similar for the two approaches.
T6	Claim 1671 1869	The advantages of a long-lasting improved body image and cosmesis for this relatively young patient population may compensate for the longer operating times and higher costs, particularly for women.
