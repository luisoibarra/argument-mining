T1	Premise 1137 1299	The operation time was significantly longer, and the leakage rate was higher in the transthoracic group (Student's t-test and Fischer's exact test, respectively).
T2	Premise 1309 1417	intraoperative blood loss and postoperative hospital stay were not significantly different (Student t-test).
T3	Premise 1424 1537	the Kaplan-Meier survival curves of these two groups were not significantly different by log-rank test (p=0.286).
T4	Premise 1538 1694	The score on the quality of life of transhiatal patients was significantly higher than that of transthoracic patients in the third, sixth and twelfth month.
T5	Claim 1695 1750	Transhiatal esophagectomy is a safe and fast procedure.
T6	Claim 1751 1810	The survival was similar to that of transthoracic approach.
T7	Claim 1811 1869	Its leakage rate was lower and quality of life was better.
