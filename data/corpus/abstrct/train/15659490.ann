T1	MajorClaim 1 93	The role of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) in metastatic breast cancer remains controversial.
T2	Claim 94 185	Trials with late intensification HDCT have failed to show an advantage in overall survival.
T3	Premise 813 922	Intent-to-treat CR rates for patients randomized to HDCT and AT were 12.5% and 11.1%, respectively (P = .84).
T4	Premise 923 1042	Objective response rates were 66.7% for patients in the high-dose group and 64.4% for patients in the AT arm (P = .82).
T5	Premise 1043 1352	In an intent-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences between the two treatments in median time to progression (HDCT, 11.1 months; AT, 10.6 months; P = .67), duration of response (HDCT, 13.9 months; AT, 14.3 months; P = .98), and overall survival (HDCT, 26.9 months; AT, 23.4 months; P = .60).
T6	Premise 1353 1535	HDCT was associated with significantly more myelosuppression, infection, diarrhea, stomatitis, and nausea and vomiting, whereas patients treated with AT developed more neurotoxicity.
T8	Claim 1536 1640	This trial failed to show a benefit for up-front tandem HDCT compared with standard combination therapy.
T9	Claim 1641 1693	HDCT was associated with more acute adverse effects.
