T1	Claim 1 142	In advanced not selected NSCLC chemotherapy achieved an advantage of approximately 1-2 months on median survival versus best supportive care.
T2	Claim 143 190	Chemotherapy seems to improve symptoms control,
T4	Premise 1263 1524	Despite difficulties in carrying out and analysing QoL items in such patients, the global QoL evaluated by the Spitzer's questionnaire suggested an advantage for MVC regimen (P=0.05) and a significant difference was observed in global health subdomain (P=0.04).
T5	Premise 1525 1573	The disease-related symptoms improved with time,
T6	Premise 1578 1630	the benefits lasted for the entire treatment period.
T7	Premise 1631 1894	When evaluated with the EORTC questionnaire there was significantly less nausea and vomiting (P=0.0001), appetite loss (P=0.01), insomnia (P=0.03), constipation (P=0.01) and peripheral neuropathy (P=0.01) in favour of MVC, and a trend for less hair loss (P=0.05).
T8	Premise 1895 1953	The advantage lasted for all the duration of chemotherapy.
T9	Premise 1954 2052	No differences were observed in global quality of life subdomain (P=0.40) between the two regimen.
T11	Premise 2158 2350	we reported a response rate of 43.1 and 38.6%, respectively, in MVP and MVC arm (P=0.59) and a median survival of 10.2 and 7.2 months, respectively, for cisplatin and carboplatin arm (P=0.39).
T12	Premise 2351 2573	The carboplatin containing regimen (MVC) has a significant better toxicity profile than the cisplatin containing (MVP) regimen as proven both by the EORTC questionnaires and by the WHO toxicity data reported by physicians.
T13	Claim 2574 2707	No significant differences in terms of response rate, time to progression and overall survival were observed between the two regimen.
T14	Claim 2708 2850	The two chemotherapy regimen showed a similar effectiveness in symptom palliation when evaluated with C30 addendum of EORTC QOL questionnaire.
T15	Premise 2851 3041	With the Spitzer's questionnaires a trend towards an improved quality of life index was observed during treatment with the carboplatin combination in comparison to the cisplatin combination.
T16	Premise 3042 3179	This difference, however, was not observed when the global quality of life was evaluated with the EORTC patients compiled questionnaires.
T17	Claim 3180 3412	A carboplatin containing regimen with better toxicity profile and a similar potentiality for symptoms control offers an option in comparison to similar cisplatin containing combinations in the palliative treatment of advanced NSCLC.
