T1	Claim 1467 1696	The study results suggest that K-tape could replace the bandage in DLT, and it could be an alternative choice for the breast-cancer-related lymphedema patient with poor short-stretch bandage compliance after 1-month intervention.
T2	Premise 1294 1466	The acceptance of K-tape was better than the bandage, and benefits included longer wearing time, less difficulty in usage, and increased comfort and convenience (P < 0.05).
T3	Premise 945 1063	There was no significant difference between groups in all outcome variables (P > 0.05) through the whole study period.
T4	Premise 1064 1197	Excess limb size (circumference and water displacement) and excess water composition were reduced significantly in the bandage group;
T5	Premise 1198 1293	excess circumference and excess water composition were reduced significantly in the tape group.
T6	MajorClaim 1860 1926	More efficient treatment protocol is needed for clinical practice.
T7	Claim 1784 1859	these two treatment protocols are inefficient and cost time in application.
