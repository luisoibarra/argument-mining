T1	Premise 935 1231	Patients randomly assigned to the intervention arm showed significant improvements on symptoms of depression (p < 0.05) and anxiety (p < 0.05), health-related QOL (p < 0.05) (i.e. better global health status, and physical and emotional functioning, and less insomnia) when compared with controls.

T4	Claim 1807 1897	However, the intervention was not found to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death.
