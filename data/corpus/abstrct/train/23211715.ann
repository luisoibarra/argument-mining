T1	Premise 1264 1455	Median survival was: OSC + WBRT 49 days (95% confidence interval 39-61), OSC 51 days (95% confidence interval 27-57) - hazard ratio 1.11 (95% confidence interval 0.80-1.53) in favour of WBRT.
T2	Premise 1456 1528	Quality of life assessed using EQ-5D showed no evidence of a difference.
