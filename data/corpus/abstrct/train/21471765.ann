T1	Premise 1211 1486	At 6 months, there was a clinically relevant, but nonsignificant reduction in presentations to emergency departments (21% vs 33%; χ1 = 1.41, P = .23) and readmission to the hospital (37% vs 47%; χ1 = 0.82, P = .37) among intervention compared with control group participants.
T2	Premise 1487 1629	Nonsignificant differences between groups were found for all unmet supportive care need and quality-of-life scores, change scores, and trends.
T3	Premise 1630 1755	However, at 6 months, total quality-of-life scores were higher for intervention group patients than controls (106.0 vs 98.6).
T4	Claim 1803 2008	Improvements in total quality-of-life change scores demonstrated that at 6 months, improvements were more than twice as large and clinically significant in the intervention compared with the control group.
T5	Claim 2009 2173	CONNECT has shown promising indications on health system and patient outcomes that warrant a larger study to further investigate the potential of this intervention.
