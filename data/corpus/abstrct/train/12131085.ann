T1	Claim 131 268	A colonic J-pouch may reduce excessive stool frequency and incontinence after anterior resection, but at the risk of evacuation problems.
T2	Claim 269 368	Experimental surgery on pigs has suggested that a coloplasty pouch (CP) may be a useful alternative
T3	Premise 1187 1306	At 4 months, J-pouch patients had 10.3% less stool fragmentation but poorer stool deferment and more nocturnal leakage.
T4	Premise 1316 1413	there were no differences in the bowel function, continence score, and quality of life at 1 year.
T5	Premise 1414 1500	There were no differences in the anorectal manometry and endoanal ultrasound findings.
T6	Claim 1501 1597	Coloplasty pouches resulted in more anastomotic leaks and minimal differences in bowel function.
T7	Claim 1610 1674	the J-pouch remains the benchmark for routine clinical practice,
T8	Claim 1679 1767	due care (including defunctioning stoma) should be exercised in situations requiring CP.
