T1	Premise 1175 1214	fatigue, nausea, and vomiting worsened,
T2	Premise 1215 1277	but there was a reduction in pain and no change in global QOL.
T3	Premise 1278 1362	Patients in the observation arm showed considerable improvements in QOL by 3 months.
T4	Premise 977 1115	The two groups were comparable, with low global QOL scores and significant symptom burden, especially pain and fatigue, after thoracotomy.
T5	Premise 1363 1496	QOL, except for symptoms of sensory neuropathy and hearing loss, in those treated with chemotherapy returned to baseline by 9 months.
T6	Claim 1497 1702	The findings of this trial indicate that the negative effects of adjuvant chemotherapy on QOL appear to be temporary, and that improvements (with a return to baseline function) are likely in most patients.
