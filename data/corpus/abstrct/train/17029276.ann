T1	Claim 1 140	In vivo data have shown a more potent antiangiogenic effect and a higher antitumor activity of low-dose interferon (IFN) given twice daily.
T2	Premise 720 932	There were no significant differences in either PFS or OS between IFN1 and IFN5 (median of 3.7 months and median of 3.4 months PFS, respectively; median of 25.5 months and median of 17.5 months OS, respectively).
T3	Premise 933 1022	The RRs were identical in the 2 arms (6.7%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.8-16.5%).
T4	Premise 1023 1151	Two patients, 1 in each arm, remained in complete remission at the time of last follow-up, at 45+ and 38+ months from treatment.
T5	Premise 1152 1358	Thirty-two patients receiving IFN5 and 19 patients receiving IFN1 experienced Grade 3 or higher adverse events (graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]) (P = .025).
T6	Premise 1359 1453	Eighteen patients receiving IFN5 and 4 patients receiving IFN1 had dose reductions (P = .002).
T7	Premise 1454 1584	There was a significant deterioration in QOL and an increase in depression associated with IFN5 but no change was noted with IFN1.
T9	Claim 1585 1691	Compared with IFN5, IFN1 is neither more nor less effective but is less toxic, with a better reported QOL.
T11	Claim 1692 1806	These results may have implications for the design of combination regimens incorporating IFN with targeted agents.
