T1	Premise 579 751	Placebo-treated patients had a mean increase in HgB of 0.9 g/dL (range, -3.8 to +5.3) compared with 2.8 g/dL (range, -2.2 to +7.5) for epoetin-treated patients (P < .0001).
T2	Premise 752 902	During the study, 31.7% of placebo-treated patients achieved a > or = 2 g/dL HgB increase compared with 72.7% of epoetin-treated patients (P < .0001).
T3	Premise 903 1020	The incidence of RBC transfusion for placebo and epoetin treatment arms was 39.6% and 25.3% (P = .005), respectively.
T4	Premise 1124 1176	The incidence of toxicity in the groups was similar.
T5	Premise 1177 1302	Changes in the average QOL scores from baseline to the end of the study were similar in the two groups (P = not significant).
T6	Premise 1303 1512	The HgB responders (irrespective of treatment arm) had a mean change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) fatigue score from a baseline of +5.1 compared with -2.1 for the nonresponders (P = .006).
T7	Claim 1513 1605	Epoetin alfa significantly improved HgB and reduced transfusions in this patient population.
T8	Claim 1606 1710	These results support the use of weekly epoetin alfa as an ameliorative agent for cancer-related anemia.
