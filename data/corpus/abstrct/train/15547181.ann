T2	Premise 936 1605	After a median follow-up of 23 months, both groups had similar progression-free survival (medians of 15.0 months for docetaxel-carboplatin and 14.8 months for paclitaxel-carboplatin; hazard ratio [HR] docetaxel-paclitaxel = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 1.13; P = .707), overall survival rates at 2 years (64.2% and 68.9%, respectively; HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.39; P = .238), and objective tumor (58.7% and 59.5%, respectively; difference between docetaxel and paclitaxel = -0.8%, 95% CI = -8.6% to 7.1%; P = .868) and CA-125 (75.8% and 76.8%, respectively; difference docetaxel-paclitaxel = -1.0%, 95% CI = -7.2% to 5.1%; P = .794) response rates.
T3	Premise 1606 1946	However, docetaxel-carboplatin was associated with substantially less overall and grade 2 or higher neurotoxicity than paclitaxel-carboplatin (grade > or =2 neurosensory toxicity in 11% versus 30%, difference = 19%, 95% CI = 15% to 24%; P<.001; grade > or =2 neuromotor toxicity in 3% versus 7%, difference = 4%, 95% CI = 1% to 7%; P<.001).
T4	Premise 1947 2195	Treatment with docetaxel-carboplatin was associated with statistically significantly more grade 3-4 neutropenia (94% versus 84%, difference = 11%, 95% CI = 7% to 14%; P<.001) and neutropenic complications than treatment with paclitaxel-carboplatin,
T5	Premise 2196 2272	although myelosuppression did not influence dose delivery or patient safety.
T6	Premise 2273 2321	Global quality of life was similar in both arms,
T7	Premise 2322 2391	but substantive differences in many symptom scores favored docetaxel.
T8	Claim 2392 2513	Docetaxel-carboplatin appears to be similar to paclitaxel-carboplatin in terms of progression-free survival and response,
T9	Claim 2514 2591	although longer follow-up is required for a definitive statement on survival.
T10	MajorClaim 2592 2727	Thus, docetaxel-carboplatin represents an alternative first-line chemotherapy regimen for patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.
