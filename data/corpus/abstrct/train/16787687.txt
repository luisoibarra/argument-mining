 Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) do not have curative treatment options; therefore, treatments should prolong survival and improve quality of life (QoL). We compared the effect on QoL of two docetaxel-platinum regimens with vinorelbine-cisplatin. QoL was assessed by the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) and the general EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) in 926 chemotherapy-na√Øve patients with stages IIIB to IV NSCLC. Patients were randomly assigned to receive: docetaxel 75 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks (DC); docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and carboplatin 6 mg/ml min, every 3 weeks (DCb); or vinorelbine 25 mg/m2/week plus cisplatin 100 mg/m2, every 4 weeks (VC). Overall, patients treated with either docetaxel-containing regimen had better QoL than VC-treated patients (LCSS global item "QoL today": P=0.064 for DC and P=0.016 for DCb versus VC; EQ-5D global item "health state today": P=0.016 for DC and P<0.001 for DCb versus VC). DC-treated patients experienced improved pain relief compared with VC (P=0.033), whereas pain relief with DCb and VC was similar. Patients treated with either docetaxel regimen had more favorable changes in performance status (P=0.065 for DC and P<0.001 for DCb versus VC) and mean weight loss (0.06 kg, gain of 0.08 kg, and 2.27 kg for DC, DCb, and VC, respectively; P<0.001 for both DC versus VC and DCb versus VC). The TAX 326 study shows that docetaxel-platinum regimens relieve symptoms and improve QoL in patients with advanced NSCLC. DCb and DC were superior to VC in all QoL outcomes assessed except for the difference between DC and VC in LCSS "QoL today", which was not significant.
