 The TAX 327 study compared docetaxel administered every 3 weeks (D3), weekly docetaxel (D1), and mitoxantrone (M), each with prednisone (P), in 1,006 men with metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer (HRPC). The original analysis, undertaken in August 2003 when 557 deaths had occurred, showed significantly better survival and response rates for pain, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and quality of life for D3P when compared with MP. Here, we report an updated analysis of survival. Investigators were asked to provide the date of death or last follow-up for all participants who were alive in August 2003. By March 2007, data on 310 additional deaths were obtained (total = 867 deaths). The survival benefit of D3P compared with MP has persisted with extended follow-up (P = .004). Median survival time was 19.2 months (95% CI, 17.5 to 21.3 months) in the D3P arm, 17.8 months (95% CI, 16.2 to 19.2 months) in the D1P arm, and 16.3 months (95% CI, 14.3 to 17.9 months) in the MP arm. More patients survived >/= 3 years in the D3P and D1P arms (18.6% and 16.6%, respectively) compared with the MP arm (13.5%). Similar trends in survival between treatment arms were seen for men greater than and less than 65 years of age, for those with and without pain at baseline, and for those with baseline PSA greater than and less than the median value of 115 ng/mL. The present analysis confirms that survival of men with metastatic HRPC is significantly longer after treatment with D3P than with MP. Consistent results are observed across subgroups of patients.
