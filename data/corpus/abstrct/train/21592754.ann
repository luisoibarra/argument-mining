T1	Premise 767 950	The estimated median overall survival times for RS + WBRT and S + WBRT patients were 6.2 and 2.8 months, respectively (hazard ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.20-1.43, P = 0.20).
T2	Premise 951 1035	Corresponding median failure-free survival times were 3.1 and 1.7 months (P = 0.20).
T3	Premise 1036 1235	For 19 'per protocol' patients, 2/10 in the RS + WBRT arm had distant intracranial failure (one also had local failure) and 3/9 S + WBRT patients had distant intracranial failure (no local failures).
T4	Premise 1236 1286	There were no grade 3-4 late radiation toxicities.
T5	Claim 1287 1397	Two months after starting treatment there were no significant differences in quality of life between the arms.
T6	Claim 1398 1586	This randomised trial encountered the accrual difficulties and consequent low statistical power commonly associated with interdisciplinary studies drawing from a small eligible population,
