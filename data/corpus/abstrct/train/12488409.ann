T1	Premise 894 1028	There was no difference in response rates, with 64% (complete response [CR], 9%) for fludarabine versus 52% (CR, 7%) for CVP (P =.72).
T2	Premise 1029 1199	With a median follow-up of 42 months, median PFS (11 months v 9.1 months; P =.03) and TFS (15 months v 11 months; P =.02) were superior in patients receiving fludarabine.
T3	Premise 1200 1310	No difference in median overall survival was detected (57 months for fludarabine v 44 months for CVP; P =.95).
T4	Premise 1311 1432	Three patients receiving fludarabine died of treatment-related toxicity compared with none of the patients receiving CVP.
T5	Premise 1433 1494	Peripheral neuropathy and alopecia were more common with CVP.
T6	Premise 1495 1574	Patients receiving fludarabine had higher scores for social function (P =.008);
T7	Premise 1575 1617	no other differences in QoL were detected.
T8	Claim 1618 1756	In recurrent low-grade lymphoma, fludarabine improves PFS, TFS, and social function scores in comparison with CVP but does not improve OS.
