T1	Premise 1118 1193	The projected 2-year PFS is 90.4% on three cycles and 89.4% on four cycles.
T2	Premise 1194 1297	The difference in PFS between three and four cycles is -1.0% (80% confidence limit [CL], -3.8%, +1.8%).
T3	Claim 1298 1421	Equivalence for three versus four cycles is claimed because both the upper and lower bounds of the 80% CL are less than 5%.
T4	Premise 1422 1558	In the 5- versus 3-day comparison, the projected 2-year PFS is 88.8% and 89.7%, respectively (difference, -0.9%, (80% CL, -4.1%, +2.2%).
T5	Claim 1566 1613	equivalence is claimed in this comparison also.
T6	Premise 1614 1696	Frequencies of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were essentially similar.
T7	Premise 1697 1770	Quality of life was maintained better in patients receiving three cycles;
T8	Premise 1771 1834	no differences were detected between 3 and 5 days of treatment.
T9	Claim 1852 1960	three cycles of BEP, with etoposide at 500 mg/m(2), is sufficient therapy in good-prognosis germ cell cancer
T10	Claim 1970 2085	the administration of the chemotherapy in 3 days has no detrimental effect on the effectiveness of the BEP regimen.
