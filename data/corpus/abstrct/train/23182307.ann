T1	Premise 1036 1166	The primary outcome was significantly lower in the intervention arm (adjusted difference -16.8, 95% CI -28.34 to -5.3; P = 0.006).
T2	Premise 1167 1403	The SCNS physical and patient care subscales (-14.2, 95% CI -26.2 to -2.2; P = 0.02 and -7.4, 95% CI -13.7 to -1.1; P = 0.02, respectively) and self-reported health state (12.8, 95% CI 3.2 to 22.4; P = 0.01) also differed significantly.
T3	Premise 1404 1488	The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £19,390 per quality-adjusted life year.
T4	Claim 1489 1608	This intervention significantly reduced the unmet needs of cancer survivors and it is likely that it is cost-effective.
T5	Claim 1609 1664	Despite small numbers, the main effect size was robust.
T6	Claim 1665 1765	We recommend implementation alongside evaluation in wider clinical settings and patient populations.
