T1	Premise 778 871	No changes were found in arm circumference or arm volume as a result of the exercise program.
T2	Premise 872 1044	Three of the quality-of-life domains showed trends toward increases in the exercise group: physical functioning (P =.050), general health (P =.048), and vitality (P =.023).
T3	Premise 1045 1125	Mental health increased, although not significantly, for all subjects (P =.019).
T4	Premise 1126 1229	Arm volume measured by water displacement was correlated with calculated arm volume (r =.973, P <.001),
T5	Premise 1230 1315	although the exercise and control group means were significantly different (P <.001).
T6	Claim 1525 1614	Additional studies should be done in this area to determine the optimum training program.
T8	Claim 1316 1524	Participation in an upper-body exercise program caused no changes in arm circumference or arm volume in women with lymphedema after breast cancer, and they may have experienced an increase in quality of life.
