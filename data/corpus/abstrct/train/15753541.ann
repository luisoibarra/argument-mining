T2	MajorClaim 143 282	Thalidomide, which is an inhibitor of TNF-alpha synthesis, may represent a novel and rational approach to the treatment of cancer cachexia.
T3	Premise 869 1217	At four weeks, patients who received thalidomide had gained on average 0.37 kg in weight and 1.0 cm(3) in arm muscle mass (AMA) compared with a loss of 2.21 kg (absolute difference -2.59 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) -4.3 to -0.8); p = 0.005) and 4.46 cm(3) (absolute difference -5.6 cm(3) (95% CI -8.9 to -2.2); p = 0.002) in the placebo group.
T4	Premise 1218 1514	At eight weeks, patients in the thalidomide group had lost 0.06 kg in weight and 0.5 cm(3) in AMA compared with a loss of 3.62 kg (absolute difference -3.57 kg (95% CI -6.8 to -0.3); p = 0.034) and 8.4 cm(3) (absolute difference -7.9 cm(3) (95% CI -14.0 to -1.8); p = 0.014) in the placebo group.
T5	Premise 1515 1612	Improvement in physical functioning correlated positively with weight gain (r = 0.56, p = 0.001).
T6	Claim 1613 1767	Thalidomide was well tolerated and effective at attenuating loss of weight and lean body mass in patients with cachexia due to advanced pancreatic cancer.
