 Epoetin alfa administered at 40,000 U once weekly (qw) to anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy increases hemoglobin levels, improves quality of life (QOL), and reduces transfusions. The benefit of epoetin alfa in maintaining hemoglobin levels in cancer patients with hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL has not been evaluated. Breast cancer patients (N = 354) receiving chemotherapy were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to epoetin alfa (40,000 U qw) or standard of care (SOC). QOL was assessed at baseline and week 12. Hemoglobin responses, transfusion requirements, and prognostic factors for responses were measured. At week 12, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An; mean, 2.16 +/- 12.84 for epoetin alfa v -4.43 +/- 13.42 for SOC) and FACT-An fatigue (mean, 1.85 +/- 10.52 for epoetin alfa v -3.55 +/- 11.14 for SOC) change scores were significantly higher in the epoetin alfa group (P < .0001). Hemoglobin responses defined as mean hemoglobin > or = 12 g/dL or a > or = 2 g/dL increase compared with baseline were significantly higher in the epoetin alfa group versus SOC: 52.0% v 5.1% and 65.7% v 6.3%, respectively (P < .0001 for both comparisons). Percentage transfused was significantly lower in the epoetin alfa group compared with SOC (8.6% v 22.9%). More than 90% of patients did not require a dose increase and 28.7% had a dose reduction. Epoetin alfa administered at 40,000 U qw is effective in improving QOL, maintaining hemoglobin level, and reducing transfusion requirements in breast cancer patients. The high effectiveness observed could be attributed in part to early treatment with epoetin alfa.
