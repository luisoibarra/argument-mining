T1	Premise 1747 1869	No significant differences were noted in the distress levels before and after completion of the study in the three groups.
T2	Premise 1870 2274	For the secondary outcomes, patients reported that dignity therapy was significantly more likely than the other two interventions to have been helpful (χ(2)=35·50, df=2; p<0·0001), improve quality of life (χ(2)=14·52; p=0·001), increase sense of dignity (χ(2)=12·66; p=0·002), change how their family saw and appreciated them (χ(2)=33·81; p<0·0001), and be helpful to their family (χ(2)=33·86; p<0·0001).
T3	Premise 2275 2521	Dignity therapy was significantly better than client-centred care in improving spiritual wellbeing (χ(2)=10·35; p=0·006), and was significantly better than standard palliative care in terms of lessening sadness or depression (χ(2)=9·38; p=0·009);
T4	Premise 2522 2717	significantly more patients who had received dignity therapy reported that the study group had been satisfactory, compared with those who received standard palliative care (χ(2)=29·58; p<0·0001).
T5	Claim 2718 2863	Although the ability of dignity therapy to mitigate outright distress, such as depression, desire for death or suicidality, has yet to be proven,
T6	Claim 2864 2987	its benefits in terms of self-reported end-of-life experiences support its clinical application for patients nearing death.
