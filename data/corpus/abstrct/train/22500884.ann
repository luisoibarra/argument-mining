T1	Premise 1711 1847	At week 12, changes in TPV for degarelix and goserelin were similar (-37.2% vs -39.0%) and met the predefined non-inferiority criterion.
T2	Premise 1848 2045	Decreases in IPSS were greater in degarelix than in goserelin-treated patients, differences being statistically significant in patients with baseline IPSS > 13 (-6.7 ± 1.8 vs -4.0 ± 1.0; P = 0.02).
T3	Premise 2046 2201	The number of patients with an IPSS change of ≥ 3 over baseline was also significantly higher in patients treated with degarelix (61.0 vs 44.3%, P = 0.02).
T4	Claim 2202 2247	Both treatments were safe and well tolerated.
T5	Claim 2248 2328	Medical castration reduces TPV and could also improve LUTS in patients with PCa.
T6	Claim 2335 2440	the short-term efficacy of degarelix and goserelin + bicalutamide was the same in terms of TPV reduction,
T7	Claim 2441 2671	degarelix showed superiority in LUTS relief in symptomatic patients, which could highlight the different actions of these drugs on extrapituitary gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in the bladder and/or the prostate.
