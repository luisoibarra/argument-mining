T2	Claim 74 196	Aerobic exercise and psychosocial interventions have been shown to reduce the severity of this symptom in cancer patients.
T3	Premise 927 1113	Physical performance of the training group improved significantly during the programme (9.4+/-20 watts, p=0.01) but remained unchanged in the relaxation group (1.5+/-14.8 watts, p=0.37).
T5	Premise 1114 1303	Fatigue and global health scores improved in both groups during the intervention (fatigue: training group 21%, relaxation group 19%; global health of both groups 19%, p for all < or =0.01);
T6	Premise 1304 1403	however, there was no significant difference between changes in the scores of both groups (p=0.67).
T7	Claim 1404 1549	We conclude that a structured aerobic training programme improves the physical performance of patients recovering from surgery for solid tumours.
T8	Claim 1550 1664	However, exercise is not better than progressive relaxation training for the treatment of fatigue in this setting.
