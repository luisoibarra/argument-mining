T1	MajorClaim 1 124	Relapse after completing adjuvant tamoxifen therapy is a persistent threat for women with hormone-responsive breast cancer.
T3	Premise 522 795	At a median follow-up of 30 months, letrozole significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS; P<0.001), the primary end point, compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence or contralateral breast cancer 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45, 0.76] P<0.001).
T4	Premise 796 987	Furthermore, letrozole significantly improved distant DFS (HR=0.60; 95% CI 0.43, 0.84; P=0.002) and, in women with node-positive tumors, overall survival (HR=0.61; 95% CI 0.38, 0.98; P=0.04).
T5	Premise 988 1254	Clinical benefits, including an overall survival advantage, were also seen in women who crossed over from placebo to letrozole after unblinding, indicating that tumors remain sensitive to hormone therapy despite a prolonged period since discontinuation of tamoxifen.
T7	Claim 1474 1550	MA.17 showed that letrozole is extremely well-tolerated relative to placebo.
T8	Claim 1551 1617	Letrozole should be considered for all women completing tamoxifen;
T9	Claim 1618 1819	new results from the post-unblinding analysis suggest that letrozole treatment should also be considered for all disease-free women for periods up to 5 years following completion of adjuvant tamoxifen.
