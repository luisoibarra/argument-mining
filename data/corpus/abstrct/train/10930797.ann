T1	Premise 985 1133	The final multivariate model predicted poor survival with multiple sites of visceral disease (P=0.003), DFI </=2 years (P=0.026) and pain (P=0.003).
T2	Premise 843 984	For survival, multiple sites of visceral disease, pain, global QL and fatigue were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis.
T3	Premise 1134 1248	For response, age, dyspnoea, fatigue and global QL were significant predictive factors in the univariate analysis.
T4	Premise 1249 1408	The final multivariate model for response selected DFI (P=0.009), multiple sites of visceral disease (P=0.037) and dyspnoea (P=<0.001) using forward selection,
T5	Premise 1409 1548	but model instability was indicated by the inclusion of fatigue and emotional function in the final model when backward selection was used.
T6	Claim 1588 1721	patient-assessed QL variables appear to be prognostic for survival and response to chemotherapy in women with advanced breast cancer.
T7	Claim 1722 1892	However, identification of prognostic factors from responses to questionnaires may be unstable, and their reliability and clinical utility should be tested prospectively.
