 Chemotherapy is moderately efficient as a treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but patient survival and quality of life has improved with this modality in some trials. In a previous phase II trial, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus cisplatin (FUP) yielded a 26.5% response rate and a 29% survival rate at 1 year. The present study aimed to compare FUP with 5-FU alone, which was the control arm in former Mayo Clinic trials. Patients with untreated cytologically or histologically proven metastatic or locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were deemed measurable or evaluable. Chemotherapy regimens consisted of a control FU arm (5-FU 500 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days) and the investigational FUP arm (continuous 5-FU 1000 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days plus cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) on day 1 or day 2). In both arms, chemotherapy was repeated at day 29. Two-hundred and seven patients from 18 centres were randomised: 103 in the FU arm and 104 in FUP arm. Treatment arms were balanced with respect to performance status grade 0-1 (83% versus 86%, respectively) and the presence of metastases (92% versus 89%, respectively). The median number of cycles administered was two in both arms (range 0-14). Five patients did not receive any chemotherapy and 45 received only one cycle. Toxicity (WHO grade 3-4) was lower with FU than with FUP (20% versus 48%, P <0.001), as was neutropenia (6% versus 23%), vomiting (4% versus 17%) and toxicity-related deaths (one versus four early in the trial). The response rate was low in both arms, but superior in the FUP arm: 12% versus 0% (intention-to-treat analysis, P <0.01). The survival rates at 6 months were 28% and 38% for the FU and FUP arms, respectively, and 1-year survival rates were 9% and 17% (log-rank test, P = 0.10). One-year progression-free survival was 0% with FU versus 10% with FUP (log-rank test, P = 0.0001). In advanced pancreatic carcinomas with a poor prognosis, FUP was superior to FU in terms of response and progression-free survival, but not in terms of overall survival. The low response rate is partly related to the number of patients who received only one cycle of chemotherapy. A more effective, better tolerated version of this FUP combination is needed.
