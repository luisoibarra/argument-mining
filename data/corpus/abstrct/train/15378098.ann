T1	Premise 867 1007	With a mixed modeling approach, total FACIT F scores for the entire sample declined at a significant rate (p = 0.003) beginning with cycle 3
T2	Premise 1008 1067	but at a slower rate for the experimental group (p = 0.02).
T3	Premise 1068 1233	Fatigue scores indicated less increase and physical well-being subscale scores showed less decline for the experimental group (p = 0.008 and p = 0.02, respectively).
T4	Premise 1234 1451	Women with advanced breast cancer randomized to the seated exercise intervention had a slower decline in total and physical well-being and less increase in fatigue scores starting with the third cycle of chemotherapy.
T5	Claim 1452 1592	Seated exercise may be a feasible exercise program for women with advanced cancer for controlling fatigue and improving physical well-being.
