T1	Premise 891 1040	An objective response (complete [CR] or partial [PR]) was obtained in 55%, 48%, 16%, and 7% of patients treated with CEF, E, M, and MV, respectively.
T2	Premise 1041 1138	A response to CEF tended to last longer than a response to E (median, 12 v 10.5 months; P = .07).
T3	Premise 1139 1263	Treatment-related toxicity was less in the single-agent arm and quality-of-life (QOL) analysis favored the single-agent arm.
T4	Premise 1264 1356	No significant difference in time to progression or survival was found between the two arms.
T5	Premise 1357 1577	Similarly, no difference in survival was found when the patients who received both the planned first-and second-line treatments were compared or when survival was calculated from the beginning of the second-line therapy.
T6	Claim 1578 1770	Patients treated with single-agent E followed by single-agent M had similar survival, but less treatment-related toxicity and better QOL as compared with those treated with CEF followed by MV.
