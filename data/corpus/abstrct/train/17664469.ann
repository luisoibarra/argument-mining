T1	Premise 902 1029	ORR was 25.0% (95% CI, 13% to 41%) for ECF, 18.5% (95% CI, 9% to 34%) for TC, and 36.6% (95% CI, 23% to 53%) for TCF (n = 119).
T2	Premise 1030 1127	Median overall survival times were 8.3, 11.0, and 10.4 months for ECF, TC, and TCF, respectively.

T4	Premise 1184 1288	Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in more treatment cycles with docetaxel (TC, 49%; TCF, 57%; ECF, 34%).

T6	Premise 1517 1628	A trend towards increased myelosuppression and infectious complications with TCF versus TC or ECF was observed.
T7	Premise 1409 1516	Time to response and ORR favor TCF over TC for further evaluation, particularly in the neoadjuvant setting.
