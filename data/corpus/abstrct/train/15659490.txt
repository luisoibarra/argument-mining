 The role of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) in metastatic breast cancer remains controversial. Trials with late intensification HDCT have failed to show an advantage in overall survival. This study was initiated to compare up-front tandem HDCT and standard combination therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients without prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomly assigned to standard combination therapy with doxorubicin and paclitaxel (AT) or double HDCT with cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and etoposide followed by peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation. HDCT was repeated after 6 weeks. Patients were stratified by menopausal and hormone-receptor status. The primary objective was to compare complete response (CR) rates. A total of 93 patients were enrolled onto the trial. Intent-to-treat CR rates for patients randomized to HDCT and AT were 12.5% and 11.1%, respectively (P = .84). Objective response rates were 66.7% for patients in the high-dose group and 64.4% for patients in the AT arm (P = .82). In an intent-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences between the two treatments in median time to progression (HDCT, 11.1 months; AT, 10.6 months; P = .67), duration of response (HDCT, 13.9 months; AT, 14.3 months; P = .98), and overall survival (HDCT, 26.9 months; AT, 23.4 months; P = .60). HDCT was associated with significantly more myelosuppression, infection, diarrhea, stomatitis, and nausea and vomiting, whereas patients treated with AT developed more neurotoxicity. This trial failed to show a benefit for up-front tandem HDCT compared with standard combination therapy. HDCT was associated with more acute adverse effects.
