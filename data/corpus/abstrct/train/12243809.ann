T3	Premise 1279 1384	The incidence of Grade 4 toxicity was 56% in patients receiving mitomycin-C and 29% in those who did not.
T4	Premise 1385 1491	Only 1 patient in each group had acute nonhematologic toxicity greater than Grade 3 (nausea and vomiting).
T5	Premise 1492 1538	No acute Grade 4 radiation toxicity developed.
T6	Premise 1539 1608	The incidences of long-term toxicity were equivalent across the arms.
T7	Premise 1609 1798	Three treatment-related deaths occurred: 2 patients in the surgical arms (one late pulmonary toxicity and one pulmonary embolus), and 1 patient in the radiation arm (radiation pneumonitis).
T8	Premise 1799 1859	Induction chemotherapy was completed in 78% of the patients.
T9	Premise 1860 1938	Complete resection was performed in 73% of 26 patients undergoing thoracotomy.
T10	Premise 1939 2003	Consolidation chemotherapy was completed in 75% of the patients.
T11	Premise 2004 2079	No statistically significant difference was found among the treatment arms.
T12	Premise 2080 2160	The overall progression-free survival rate was 53% at 1 year and 17% at 3 years.
T13	Premise 2161 2212	The median progression-free survival was 14 months.
T14	Premise 2213 2348	No difference in the 1-year survival rate (70% vs. 66%) or median survival time (19.4 vs. 17.4 months) between the surgery and RT arms.
T15	Premise 2349 2438	The median survival in the patients receiving induction chemotherapy only was 8.9 months.
T16	Premise 2439 2488	Mitomycin-C had no impact on survival (p = 0.75).
T17	Premise 2489 2601	No statistically significant difference was noted in the time to local failure between the surgical and RT arms.
T18	Claim 2602 2666	The patient accrual to this trial made its results inconclusive,
T19	Claim 2720 2845	histologic confirmation of N2 disease in the surgical and nonsurgical arms eliminated the usual biases from clinical staging.
T20	Claim 2863 2946	local control and survival were essentially equal between the surgical and RT arms.
T21	Claim 2947 3062	The 3- and 5-year survival rates of nonsurgical therapy were comparable to published surgical trials of N2 disease.
