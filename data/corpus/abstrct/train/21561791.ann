T1	Premise 1004 1132	The 2-year risk of progression for PSA nadir ≤ 0.2 ng/ml, and > 0.2 to 4 ng/ml in CAD was 31% and 70% (P < 0.001), respectively.
T2	Premise 1133 1176	In the IAD group, a similar trend was seen.
T3	Premise 1177 1327	Patients with PSA nadir ≤ 0.2 ng/ml, though had significantly higher 2-year risk of progression compared to CAD (53% vs. 31% (P = 0.03), respectively.
T4	Premise 1368 1458	Patients without pain had a significantly lower 2-year risk of progression in both groups.
T5	Premise 1620 1692	No QOL difference was found, although more side effects occurred in CAD.
T6	Claim 1693 1809	Metastatic prostate cancer patients with high baseline PSA, pain, and high PSA nadir have a poor prognosis with ADT.
T7	Claim 1810 1888	Patients with low PSA nadir do significantly worse with IAD compared with CAD.
T8	Claim 1989 2069	IAD is not a good treatment option for many metastatic prostate cancer patients.
T9	Premise 1459 1524	Without ADT testosterone remained at castrate level for 4 months.
