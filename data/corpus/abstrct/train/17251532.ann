T1	MajorClaim 1 168	The efficacy and safety of uterine-artery embolization, as compared with standard surgical methods, for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids remain uncertain.
T2	Premise 664 778	There were no significant differences between groups in any of the eight components of the SF-36 scores at 1 year.
T3	Premise 779 957	The embolization group had a shorter median duration of hospitalization than the surgical group (1 day vs. 5 days, P<0.001) and a shorter time before returning to work (P<0.001).
T4	Premise 958 1027	At 1 year, symptom scores were better in the surgical group (P=0.03).
T5	Premise 1028 1211	During the first year of follow-up, there were 13 major adverse events in the embolization group (12%) and 10 in the surgical group (20%) (P=0.22), mostly related to the intervention.
T6	Premise 1212 1334	Ten patients in the embolization group (9%) required repeated embolization or hysterectomy for inadequate symptom control.
T7	Premise 1335 1520	After the first year of follow-up, 14 women in the embolization group (13%) required hospitalization, 3 of them for major adverse events and 11 for reintervention for treatment failure.
T8	Claim 1521 1677	In women with symptomatic fibroids, the faster recovery after embolization must be weighed against the need for further treatment in a minority of patients.
