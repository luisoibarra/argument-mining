 The management of cancer-related anorexia/cachexia syndrome (CACS) is a great challenge in clinical practice. To date, practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of CACS are lacking. The authors conducted a randomized study to confirm the effectiveness and safety of treatment of CACS utilizing megestrol acetate (MA) plus thalidomide. One hundred and two candidates with CACS were randomly assigned to two treatment groups (trial group and control group): the trial group received MA (160 mg po, bid) plus thalidomide (50 mg po, bid), while the control group received MA (160 mg po, bid) alone. Treatment duration was 8 weeks. Analysis of the trial group demonstrated a significant increase from baseline in body weight (<0.01), quality of life (p = 0.02), appetite (p = 0.01), and grip strength (p = 0.01), and a significant decrease in fatigue, Glasgow Prognostic Score (p = 0.05), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (p = 0.03), IL-6 (p < 0.01), and tumor necrosis factor-α (p = 0.02). In contrast, in the control group, endpoints with a significant improvement from baseline included body weight (p < 0.02) and appetite (p = 0.02). The mean changes in the endpoints from baseline in the trial group were significantly greater compared with the control group: in the primary endpoints, body weight (p = 0.05), fatigue (p < 0.01) and quality of life (p = 0.01), and in the secondary endpoints, grip strength (p = 0.05), Glasgow Prognostic Score (p = 0.02), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (p = 0.02), IL-6 (p < 0.01) and tumor necrosis factor-α (p = 0.01). Toxicity was found to be relatively negligible in both groups. A combination regimen of MA and thalidomide is more effective than MA alone in the treatment of CACS.
