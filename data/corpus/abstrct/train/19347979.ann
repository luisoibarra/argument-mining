T1	Premise 933 1035	Patients carrying a GCLC 77 genotype had a worse overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.5, p = 0.05).
T2	Premise 1036 1360	Patients carrying the GPX1-CC genotype had a clinically significant decline in the UNISCALE (odds ratio (OR): 7.5; p = 0.04), total Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung score (OR: 11.0; p = 0.04), physical (OR: 7.1; p = 0.03), functional (OR: 5.2; p = 0.04), and emotional well-being constructs (OR: 23.8; p = 0.01).
T3	Claim 1361 1515	Genotypes of glutathione-related enzymes, especially GCLC, may be used as host factors in predicting patients' survival after platinum-based chemotherapy.
T4	Claim 1516 1576	GPX1 may be an inherited factor in predicting patients' QOL.
T5	Claim 1577 1737	Further investigation to define and measure the effects of these genes in chemotherapeutic regimens, drug toxicities, disease progression, and QOL are critical.
