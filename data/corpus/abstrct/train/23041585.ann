T1	Premise 803 924	The median PFS was 12.1 months in Arm A and B [hazard ratio (HR) 0.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85-1.15; P = 0.93].
T2	Premise 718 802	Grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicity was higher in Arm B (31% versus 22% P = 0.001).
T3	Premise 635 717	The median AUCs (cycle 2-6) received were 6.0 (Arm A) and 7.2 (Arm B) (P < 0.001).
T4	Premise 925 1051	The median overall survival (OS) was 34.1 and 30.7 months in Arms A and B, respectively (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.81-1.18, P = 0.82).
T5	Premise 1052 1274	In multivariate analysis, baseline neutrophil (P < 0.001), baseline platelet counts (P < 0.001) and the difference between white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil count (P = 0.009) had a significant adverse prognostic value.
T6	Claim 1275 1368	Intrapatient dose escalation of carboplatin based on nadir blood counts is feasible and safe.
T7	Claim 1369 1444	However, it provided no improvement in PFS or OS compared with flat dosing.
