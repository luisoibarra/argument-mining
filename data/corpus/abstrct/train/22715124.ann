T1	Premise 854 972	Depression scores yielded a linear interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.019), with decreases in SMEX but not UCO.
T2	Premise 973 1100	Anxiety scores yielded a quadratic interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.049), with trends for changes in SMEX but not UCO.
T3	Premise 770 853	Interaction effects for mental and physical well-being scores were not significant.
T4	Premise 1101 1400	Additional analyses yielded quadratic interactions for exercise activity comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.022), with positive changes in SMEX but not UCO, and for stress management activity comparing UCO and SM (p < 0.001) and UCO and SMEX (p = 0.013), with positive changes in SM and SMEX but not UCO.
T5	Claim 1401 1526	Only the combined intervention yielded effects on quality of life outcomes, and these were limited to anxiety and depression.
T6	Premise 1527 1673	These findings are consistent with evidence that only the combined intervention yielded increases in both exercise and stress management activity.
