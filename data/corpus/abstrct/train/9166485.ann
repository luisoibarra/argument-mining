T1	Premise 625 733	The mean hematocrit increased by 6.0 percentage points in the r-HuEPO group versus 1.3 in the placebo group.
T2	Premise 734 1159	A decrease in transfusion requirement did not reach significance over all 3 months, but there was a significant reduction in the percentage of patients transfused in the second and third months (27% r-HuEPO vs. 56% placebo) and a trend toward reduction in the mean total number of units transfused (1.20 units r-HuEPO vs. 2.02 units placebo), suggesting a lag of 1 month before r-HuEPO can affect the transfusion requirement.
T4	Premise 1160 1294	Pretreatment serum erythropoietin levels were lower in responders than in nonresponders (73.5 IU/L and 86.3 IU/L means, respectively).
T5	Premise 1295 1403	However, the magnitude of this difference was not helpful in defining which patients were likely to respond.
T6	Premise 1404 1536	There was a significant improvement in overall quality of life between the two treatment arms in favor of the r-HuEPO-treated group.
T7	Premise 1537 1603	There were no significant adverse effects associated with r-HuEPO.
T8	Claim 1604 1781	r-HuEPO is safe and can cause a significant improvement in the hematocrit and quality of life of anemic cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive, cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
T9	Claim 1782 1861	After 1 month of r-HuEPO, there is also a reduction in transfusion requirement.
