T1	Premise 427 649	Time to progression (TTP; primary end point) and time to treatment failure (TTF) were significantly longer with AT than AC (median TTP, 37.3 v 31.9 weeks; log-rank P =.014; median TTF, 25.6 v 23.7 weeks; log-rank P =.048).
T2	Premise 650 858	The overall response rate (ORR) was significantly greater for patients taking AT (59%, with 10% complete response [CR], 49% partial response [PR]) than for those taking AC (47%, with 7% CR, 39% PR) (P =.009).
T3	Premise 859 1053	The ORR was also higher with AT in patients with visceral involvement (58% v 41%; liver, 62% v 42%; lung, 58% v 35%), three or more organs involved (59% v 40%), or prior adjuvant CT (53% v 41%).
T4	Premise 1054 1104	Overall survival (OS) was comparable in both arms.
T5	Premise 1105 1155	Grade 3/4 neutropenia was frequent in both groups,
T6	Premise 1156 1294	although febrile neutropenia and infections were more frequent for patients taking AT (respectively, 33% v 10%, P <.001; 8% v 2%, P =.01).
T7	Premise 1295 1409	Severe nonhematologic toxicity was infrequent in both groups, including grade 3/4 cardiac events (AT, 3%; AC, 4%).
T8	Claim 1410 1486	AT significantly improves TTP and ORR compared with AC in patients with MBC,
T9	Claim 1487 1520	but there is no difference in OS.
T10	Claim 1521 1575	AT represents a valid option for the treatment of MBC.
