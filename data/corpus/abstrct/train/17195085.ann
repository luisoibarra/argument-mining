T1	Premise 478 554	Operative time was 53 minutes longer in the laparoscopic group (P < 0.0001).
T2	Premise 555 665	Postoperative morbidity rate was 28.9 percent in the laparoscopic vs. 40 percent in the open group (P = 0.18).
T3	Premise 666 792	The mean length of hospital stay was 10 (4.9) days in the laparoscopic group and 13.6 (10) days in the open group (P = 0.004).
T4	Premise 793 866	Local recurrence rate and five-year survival were similar in both groups;
T5	Claim 867 939	however, the limited number of patients does not allow firm conclusions.
T6	Premise 940 1043	Quality of life was better in the laparoscopic group only in the first year after surgery (P < 0.0001).
T7	Premise 1044 1215	The additional charge in the laparoscopic group was $1,748 per patient randomized ($1,194 the result of surgical instruments and $554 the result of longer operative time).
T8	Premise 1216 1409	The saving in the laparoscopic group was $1,396 per patient randomized ($647 the result of shorter length of hospital stay and $749 the result of the lower cost of postoperative complications).
T9	Premise 1410 1511	The net balance resulted in $351 extra cost per patient randomly allocated to the laparoscopic group.
T10	Claim 1512 1577	Short-term postoperative morbidity was similar in the two groups.
T11	Claim 1578 1709	Laparoscopic resection reduced length of hospital stay, improved first-year quality of life, and slightly increased hospital costs.
