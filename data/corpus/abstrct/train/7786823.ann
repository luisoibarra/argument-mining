T1	Premise 761 825	The overall remission rate was 87% with 31% complete remissions.
T2	Premise 826 932	The median survival of all 406 eligible patients was 346 days with 15% of the patients alive at two years.
T3	Premise 933 1107	The overall remission rate, the rate of complete remission, the median survival and the rate of long-term survival were not significantly different in the two treatment arms.
T4	Premise 1108 1248	In limited disease the estimated percentages of survival at 2 years were 33% in the early and 24% in the late alternating chemotherapy arms.
T5	Premise 1249 1437	Patients with extensive disease survived significantly longer with late alternating chemotherapy than on the early alternation regimen (median survival 336 days versus 301 days, p = 0.01).
T6	Premise 1438 1590	In the latter patients the received dose intensities (RDI) of cisplatin, adriamycin and etoposide were significantly higher in the late-alternation arm.
T7	Premise 1591 1809	Patients treated with early alternating chemotherapy rated their tumor symptoms, functional states, fatigue/malaise and restriction of social activity significantly better, reflecting an improved subjective adjustment.
T8	Claim 1810 1973	Alternating chemotherapy with PAV-CyMOC plus consolidating radiotherapy is a feasible and effective treatment for small-cell lung cancer, with acceptable toxicity.
T9	Claim 1982 2066	patients with early alternating chemotherapy achieve a better subjective adjustment,
T10	Claim 2067 2252	late alternating chemotherapy allows for a higher RDI of cisplatin, adriamycin and etoposide, which results in a significantly longer median survival of patients with extensive disease.
