T1	Claim 1 137	The combination of interferon alfa (IFNalpha) and isotretinoin has shown a direct antiproliferative effect on human melanoma cell lines,
T2	Claim 138 262	but it remained unclear whether this combination is more effective than IFNalpha alone in patients with metastatic melanoma.
T3	Premise 1001 1355	A scheduled interim analysis revealed no significant differences in survival rates, with the isotretinoin group and the placebo group showing 5-year disease-free survival rates of 55% (95% CI, 46% to 65%) and 67% (95% CI, 59% to 75%), respectively, and overall 5-year survival rates of 76% (95% CI, 67% to 84%) and 81% (95% CI, 74% to 88%), respectively.
T4	Claim 1392 1606	The addition of isotretinoin to an adjuvant treatment of low-dose IFNalpha in patients with stage IIA and IIB melanoma had no significant effect on disease-free or overall survival and is therefore not recommended.
