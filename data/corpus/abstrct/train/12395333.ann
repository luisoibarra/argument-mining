T2	Claim 159 269	Tamoxifen (TMX) is believed to inhibit HCC positive for estrogen receptor (ER), but most HCCs are ER negative.
T3	Claim 270 362	Results of previous phase 3 trials in inoperable HCC have been conflicting and inconclusive.
T4	Claim 363 440	At higher doses, however, TMX inhibits HCC through ER-independent mechanisms.
T5	Premise 1112 1317	Three-month survival rates for the P, TMX60, and TMX120 groups were 44%, 41%, and 35%, respectively, with a statistically significant trend difference in survival across the 3 treatment regimens (P =.011).
T6	Premise 1318 1468	There was a significantly higher risk of death in the TMX120 group compared with the P group (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.81).
T7	Premise 1469 1525	Adverse drug reactions were reported in 3% (9 patients),
T8	Premise 1530 1564	8 patients were lost to follow-up.
T9	Claim 1580 1703	TMX does not prolong survival in patients with inoperable HCC and has an increasingly negative impact with increasing dose.
T10	Claim 1704 1758	No appreciable advantage to QoL with TMX was observed.
