T4	Premise 1291 1424	An average weight gain in group B contrasted with an average weight loss in group A after four (P < 0.01) and eight weeks (P < 0.05).
T5	Premise 1425 1520	Fat-free mass showed an intergroup difference in favor of group B after eight weeks (P < 0.05).
T6	Premise 1521 1699	Body cell mass was maintained throughout the study in group B, but declined significantly up to weeks 4 and 8 in group A (intergroup difference: P < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively).
T8	Premise 1700 1805	A decrease in the total lymphocyte count by 559 cells/mul occurred with the fat-enriched diet (P < 0.05).
T9	Premise 1806 1896	Several aspects of the quality of life were rated to be better in group B than in group A,
T10	Premise 1897 1959	although not all differences reached statistical significance.
T11	Claim 1960 2077	In patients with cancer, a high-fat diet may possibly support the maintenance of both body weight and body cell mass.
T12	Claim 2078 2132	However, monitoring the lymphocyte count is advisable.
