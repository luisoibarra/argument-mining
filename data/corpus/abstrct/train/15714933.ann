T1	Premise 1016 1212	TSS improved in 49 patients (77%) on regimen 1, and in 57 (92%) patients on regimen 2, a difference of 15% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3-28) in the proportion improving between the two regimens.
T2	Premise 1213 1421	A complete resolution of all symptoms was achieved in three (5%) on regimen 1, and in 14 (23%) patients on regimen 2 (P < 0.001), a difference in the proportion between the two regimens of 21% (95% CI 10-33).
T3	Premise 1422 1557	A significantly higher proportion of patients experienced palliation and complete resolution of chest pain and dyspnoea with regimen 2.
T4	Premise 1558 1599	No differences were observed in toxicity.
T5	Premise 1600 1690	The median survival was 22.7 weeks for regimen 1 and 28.3 weeks for regimen 2 (P = 0.197).
T6	Claim 1691 1795	Although this trial met the pre-determined criteria for equivalence between the two palliative regimens,
T7	Claim 1796 1937	significantly more patients achieved complete resolution of symptoms and palliation of chest pain and dyspnoea with the fractionated regimen.
