T1	Claim 1 68	Chemotherapy can profoundly affect patients' quality of life (QOL),
T3	Premise 607 734	Overall (FACT-G) scores did not differ significantly between arms at the fourth assessment (C = 70.3 (19.6); CP = 72.8 (17.4)).
T4	Premise 735 821	Scores were stable over time and considerably lower than the general population norms.
T5	Premise 822 917	The BPI-SF revealed a decline in pain scores in both arms from the first to fourth assessments.
T6	Premise 918 1010	The CP arm produced a significantly higher response rate and progression-free survival (PFS)
T7	Premise 1011 1041	but not overall survival (OS).
T8	Premise 1042 1103	Greater myelosuppression was reported in the combination arm.
T9	Premise 1104 1199	The rate of QOL drop-out for any reason was higher for C (53%) compared to CP (38%) (P < 0.05).
T10	Claim 1290 1383	There was no significant difference in overall QOL scores between treatment arms or serially.
T11	Claim 1384 1604	Combined with QOL results, the significant increase in response and PFS in the CP arm and the higher drop-out rate in the C arm suggest a better outcome for the combination regimen despite its increased myelosuppression.
