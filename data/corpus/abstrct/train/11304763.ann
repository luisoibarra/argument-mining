T1	Premise 780 862	Complete and partial response rates to induction PE were 3% and 32%, respectively.
T2	Premise 863 956	A 7% response rate was observed with topotecan (complete response, 2%; partial response, 5%).
T3	Premise 957 1027	The median survival time for all 402 eligible patients was 9.6 months.
T4	Premise 1028 1198	Progression-free survival (PFS) from date of randomization on step 2 was significantly better with topotecan compared with observation (3.6 months v 2.3 months; P <.001).
T5	Premise 1208 1371	overall survival from date of randomization on step 2 was not significantly different between the observation and topotecan arms (8.9 months v 9.3 months; P =.43).
T6	Premise 1372 1524	Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 50% and 3%, respectively, of PE patients in step 1 and 60% and 13% of topotecan patients in step 2.
T7	Premise 1525 1612	Grade 4/5 infection was observed in 4.6% of PE patients and 1.8% of topotecan patients.
T8	Premise 1613 1682	Grade 3/4 anemia developed in 22% of patients who received topotecan.
T9	Premise 1683 1820	No difference in quality of life between topotecan and observation was observed at any assessment time or for any of the subscale scores.
T10	Claim 1821 1989	Four cycles of PE induction therapy followed by four cycles of topotecan improved PFS but failed to improve overall survival or quality of life in extensive-stage SCLC.
T11	Claim 1990 2124	Four cycles of standard PE remains an appropriate first-line treatment for extensive-stage SCLC patients with good performance status.
