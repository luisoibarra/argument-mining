T1	Claim 1349 1482	Decreasing depression symptoms over the first year were associated with longer subsequent survival for women with MBC in this sample.
T2	Premise 1081 1189	There was a significant effect of change in CES-D over the first year on survival out to 14 years (P = .007)
T3	Premise 1190 1278	but no significant interaction between treatment condition and CES-D change on survival.
T4	Premise 937 1080	Median survival time was 53.6 months for women with decreasing CES-D scores over 1 year and 25.1 months for women with increasing CES-D scores.
T5	Claim 1483 1613	Further research is necessary to confirm this hypothesis in other samples, and causation cannot be assumed based on this analysis.
