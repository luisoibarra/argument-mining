 Anaemia is common in patients receiving chemotherapy, causing symptoms that have a major impact on quality of life (QoL). Epoetin beta rapidly increases haemoglobin (Hb) levels and improves QoL in anaemic patients with a variety of tumours. This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-finding study assessing the efficacy and safety of once-weekly epoetin beta in patients with solid tumours receiving chemotherapy. Adult patients with anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dL) were randomized to receive epoetin beta 30,000 IU or 20,000 IU once weekly for 12 weeks. All patients received oral iron supplementation. Haemoglobin levels, transfusion need and QoL [Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue (FACT-F) subscale score] were assessed at regular intervals. Fifty patients were randomized; 30 patients received epoetin beta 30,000 IU once weekly and 20 received 20,000 IU once weekly. Mean (+/- SD) increase in Hb from baseline to week 12 was 1.75 +/- 2.15 g/dL in the 30,000 IU group (P = 0.008 vs. baseline) and 1.04 +/- 1.75 g/dL in the 20,000 IU group (non-significant). Haemoglobin response (increase in Hb >or=2 g/dL from baseline) was observed in 78.3% of patients receiving epoetin beta 30,000 IU and 66.7% receiving epoetin beta 20,000 IU. Improvements in FACT-F subscale score were significantly (P < 0.001) correlated with increases in Hb level. Transfusion use was low during the study in both groups. Both epoetin beta regiments were well tolerated and there were no dose-dependent adverse events. Epoetin beta 30,000 IU once weekly is an effective and well-tolerated treatment of anaemia in patients with solid tumours.
