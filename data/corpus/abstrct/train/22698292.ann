T1	Premise 878 983	Seventeen of 25 HBO-treated patients (68%) improved versus 8 of 21 controls (38.1%; P = .043, χ(2) test).
T2	Premise 984 1184	Mean time to improvement was 39.7 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.4 to 57.0 weeks) for HBO-treated patients versus 67.9 weeks (95 CI, 48.4 to 87.5 weeks) for controls (P = .03, log-rank test).
T3	Premise 1185 1489	However, complete gingival healing occurred in only 14 of 25 HBO-treated patients (52%) versus 7 of 21 controls (33.3%; P = .203, χ(2) test), and time to healing was 59 weeks (95% CI, 42.8% to 75.8%) for HBO-treated patients versus 70 weeks (95 CI, 52.2% to 88.36%) for controls (P = .32, log-rank test).
T4	Premise 1490 1566	Pain decreased faster for HBO-treated subjects (P < .01, linear regression).
T5	Premise 1567 1719	Quality-of-life scores for physical health (P = .002) and perceived health (P = .043) decreased at 6 months for control group but for not the HBO group.
T6	Claim 1720 1799	ONJ is multifactorial and no single treatment modality is likely to reverse it;
T7	Claim 1800 1903	however, it is treatable and even advanced presentations can improve with intensive multimodal therapy.
T8	Claim 1904 2070	Clinically, HBO appears to be a useful adjunct to ONJ treatment, particularly for more severe cases, although this study was underpowered to fully support this claim.
