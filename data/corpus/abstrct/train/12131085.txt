 To assess the efficacy of a novel coloplasty colonic pouch design in optimizing bowel function after ultralow anterior resection. A colonic J-pouch may reduce excessive stool frequency and incontinence after anterior resection, but at the risk of evacuation problems. Experimental surgery on pigs has suggested that a coloplasty pouch (CP) may be a useful alternative. Although CP has recently been shown to be feasible in patients, there is no randomized controlled trial comparing bowel function with the J-pouch. After anterior resection for cancer, patients were allocated to either J-pouch or CP-anal anastomoses. Continence scoring, anorectal manometry, and endoanal ultrasound assessments were made before surgery. All complications were recorded, and these preoperative assessments were repeated at 4 months. The assessments were repeated again at 1 year, and a quality of life questionnaire was added. Eighty-eight patients were recruited from October 1998 to April 2000. Both groups were well matched for age, gender, staging, adjuvant therapy, and mean follow-up. There were no differences in the intraoperative time and hospital stay. CP resulted in more anastomotic leaks. At 4 months, J-pouch patients had 10.3% less stool fragmentation but poorer stool deferment and more nocturnal leakage. However, there were no differences in the bowel function, continence score, and quality of life at 1 year. There were no differences in the anorectal manometry and endoanal ultrasound findings. Coloplasty pouches resulted in more anastomotic leaks and minimal differences in bowel function. At present, the J-pouch remains the benchmark for routine clinical practice, and due care (including defunctioning stoma) should be exercised in situations requiring CP.
