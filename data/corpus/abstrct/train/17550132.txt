 Recently, the treatment of advanced gastric cancer by continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with low-dose cisplatin (CDDP) has improved efficacy without severe toxicities. The possible effectiveness of 5-FU+low-dose CDDP for colorectal cancer (CRC) is intriguing. One hundred fifty-five patients with far-advanced CRC including at least one measurable lesion were enrolled in a prospective randomized clinical trial funded by the Japanese Foundation for Multidisciplinary Treatment of Cancer. These patients were assigned to the two arms to assess the value of low-dose CDDP when added to a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU at a dose of 300 mg/m(2)/24 hrs in a one-week cycle consisting of 5 days of treatment and 2 days of rest for at least 12 weeks. CD-DP was given intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 and days 8-12, and then at a dose of 7 mg/m(2) twice a week. Three patients were excluded from the trial. The response rate in the 5-FU+low-dose CDDP arm (n=75) was significantly higher than that in the 5-FU arm (n=77) (25.3% vs. 11.7%; P = 0.037). There was no significant difference in the median overall survival time between the 5-FU+low-dose CDDP arm and the 5-FU arm (479 and 491 days, respectively). Grades 3/4 toxicities occurred infrequently in both arms. The quality of life was almost the same between the arms. Low-dose CDDP improved the response rate while keeping toxicities within clinically acceptable limits. However, this combined treatment did not confer a survival advantage over treatment with continuous infusion of 5-FU alone for patients with far-advanced CRC; that might be attributable to the short CDDP administration setting of 12 weeks.
