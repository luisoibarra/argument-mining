 Evidence suggests that the re-entry phase (ie, early period after medical treatment completion) presents distinct challenges for cancer patients. To facilitate the transition to recovery, we conducted the Moving Beyond Cancer (MBC) trial, a multisite, randomized, controlled trial of psychoeducational interventions for breast cancer patients. Breast cancer patients were registered within 6 weeks after surgery. After medical treatment, they completed baseline measures and were randomly assigned to standard National Cancer Institute print material (CTL); standard print material and peer-modeling videotape (VID); or standard print material, videotape, two sessions with a trained cancer educator, and informational workbook (EDU). Two primary end points were examined: energy/fatigue and cancer-specific distress. Secondary end points were depressive symptoms and post-traumatic growth. Perceived preparedness for re-entry was analyzed as a moderator of effects. Of 558 women randomly assigned to treatment, 418 completed the 6-month assessment and 399 completed the 12-month assessment. In analyses controlling for study site and baseline depressive symptoms, VID produced significant improvement in energy/fatigue at 6 months relative to CTL, particularly among women who felt less prepared for re-entry at baseline. No significant main effect of the interventions emerged on cancer-specific distress, but EDU prompted greater reduction in this outcome relative to CTL at 6 months for patients who felt more prepared for re-entry. Between-group differences in the primary outcomes were not significant at 12 months, and no significant effects emerged on the secondary end points. A peer-modeling videotape can accelerate the recovery of energy during the re-entry phase in women treated for breast cancer, particularly among those who feel less prepared for re-entry.
