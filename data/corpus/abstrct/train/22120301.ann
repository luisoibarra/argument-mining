T2	Premise 1109 1215	The median OS for the vaccine group was 31.9 months and for the control group was 15.0 months (P < 0.002).
T3	Premise 1216 1346	The median progression-free survival (PFS) for the vaccine group was 8.5 months, and 8.0 months for the control group (P = 0.075).
T4	Premise 1347 1447	The surviving fraction was significantly higher in the vaccine group based on Kaplan-Meier analysis.
T5	Claim 1448 1549	Adjuvant immunotherapy with whole-cell lysate dendritic cell vaccine may improve short-term survival.
T6	Claim 1550 1638	It seems to be safe, and its long-term effectiveness is worthy of further investigation.
