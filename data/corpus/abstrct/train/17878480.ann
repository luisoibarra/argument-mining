T1	Premise 864 978	Vandetanib patients had more toxicity and required more dose modifications for gastrointestinal toxicity and rash.
T2	Premise 979 1075	Asymptomatic Corrected QT interval (QTC) prolongation was observed in eight vandetanib patients.
T3	Premise 1076 1240	Median progression-free survival for vandetanib and placebo was 2.7 and 2.8 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 80% CI, 0.75 to 1.36; one-sided P = .51).
T4	Premise 1241 1365	Overall survival for vandetanib was 10.6 versus 11.9 months for placebo (HR, 1.43; 80% CI, 1.00 to 2.05; one-sided P = 0.9).
T5	Premise 1366 1645	In planned subgroup analyses, a significant interaction was noted (P = .01): limited-stage vandetanib patients had longer overall survival (HR, 0.45; one-sided P = .07) and extensive-stage vandetanib patients shorter survival compared with placebo (HR, 2.27; one-sided P = .996).
T6	Claim 1646 1738	Vandetanib failed to demonstrate efficacy as maintenance therapy for small-cell lung cancer.
