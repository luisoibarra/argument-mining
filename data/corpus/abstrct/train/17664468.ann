T1	MajorClaim 1 193	Therapy of patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer should provide symptom relief and improve quality of life (QOL) because most patients are symptomatic at baseline.
T2	Premise 1197 1325	Time to 5% deterioration of global health status (primary end point) significantly favored DCF over CF (log-rank test, P = .01).
T3	Premise 1326 1494	QOL was preserved longer for patients on DCF than those on CF for all time to deterioration analyses, demonstrating the statistical superiority of DCF compared with CF.
T4	Claim 1704 1954	In V325, advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer patients receiving DCF not only had statistically improved overall survival and time to tumor-progression, but they also had better preservation of QOL compared with patients receiving CF.
