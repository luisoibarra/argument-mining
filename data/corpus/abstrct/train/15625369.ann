T1	Premise 918 1041	There was a significant survival advantage for GCa compared with MIC (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0. 93; P = .008).
T2	Premise 1042 1242	Median survival was 10 months with GCa and 7.6 months with MIC (difference, 2.4 months; 95% CI, 1.0 to 4.0), and 1-year survival was 40% with GCa and 30% with MIC (difference, 10%; 95% CI, 3% to 18%).
T3	Premise 1243 1316	Overall response rates were similar (42% for GCa v 41% for MIC; P = .84).
T4	Premise 1317 1367	More thrombocytopenia occurred with GCa (P = .03),
T5	Premise 1368 1442	but this was not associated with increased hospital admission or fatality.
T6	Premise 1443 1591	GCa caused less nausea, vomiting, constipation, and alopecia and was associated with fewer admissions for administration and better quality of life.
T7	Claim 1592 1732	In patients with advanced NSCLC, GCa chemotherapy was shown to be a better-tolerated treatment that conferred a survival advantage over MIC.
