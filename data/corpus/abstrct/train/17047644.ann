T1	Premise 1136 1226	There were no significant group differences in global QoL, pain or fatigue up to 26 weeks.
T2	Premise 1227 1308	The dyspnoea palliation rate was lower in the C3 arm at 18 and 26 weeks (P<0.05),
T3	Premise 1309 1380	but this finding was inconsistent across different methods of analysis.
T4	Premise 1381 1484	Median survival in the C3 group was 28 vs 32 weeks in the C6 group (P=0.75, HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82-1.31).
T5	Premise 1485 1579	One- and 2-year survival rates were 25 and 9% vs 25 and 5% in the C3 and C6 arm, respectively.
T6	Premise 1580 1707	Median progression-free survival was 16 and 21 weeks in the C3 and C6 groups, respectively (P=0.21, HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68-1.08).
T7	Claim 1708 1866	In conclusion, palliative chemotherapy with carboplatin and vinorelbine beyond three courses conveys no survival or consistent QoL benefits in advanced NSCLC.
