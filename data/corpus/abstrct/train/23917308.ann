T1	Premise 1398 1491	No adverse events or skeletal complications occurred during the supervised exercise sessions.
T2	Premise 1492 1748	The exercise program was well tolerated as evidenced by high attendance (83%) and compliance rates (93%), and the ability of the participants to exercise at an intensity within the target range for cancer survivors (rating of perceived exertion =13.8±1.5).
T3	Premise 1749 2064	The change in physical function (muscle strength ∼11%; submaximal aerobic exercise capacity ∼5% and ambulation ∼12%), physical activity level (∼24%) and lean mass (∼3%) differed significantly between groups following the intervention, with favorable changes in the exercise group compared with the usual care group.
T4	Premise 2065 2175	No significant between-group differences were observed for fatigue, quality of life or psychological distress.
T5	Claim 2176 2478	This initial evidence involving a small sample size suggests that appropriately designed and supervised resistance exercise may be safe and well tolerated by prostate cancer patients with bone metastatic disease and can lead to improvements in physical function, physical activity levels and lean mass.
T7	Claim 2479 2573	Future trials involving larger sample sizes are required to expand these preliminary findings.
