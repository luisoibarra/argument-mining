T2	Premise 1147 1514	The group treated with oral Etoposide had a significantly better QOL than the radiotherapy group for the total FLI-C score (adjusted mean plus standard error at 3-months 89 +/- 3 vs. 76 +/- 3; p = 0.004) and for the hardship (11 +/- 0.4 vs. 9 +/- 0.4; p = 0.001); social (10 +/- 0.4 vs. 8 +/- 0.4; p = 0.001) and nausea (9 +/- 0.4 vs. 8 +/- 0.4; p = 0.002) subscales.
T3	Premise 1515 1669	In addition, on the physical and psychological subscales, the Etoposide group had a significantly better QOL than the other 3 treatment groups (p < 0.04).
T4	Premise 1670 1834	The 3-drug combination, supportive care and radiotherapy groups did not differ significantly from each other with respect to the total FLI-C score or its subscales.
T5	Premise 1835 1892	There were no group differences with respect to survival.
T6	Claim 1893 1975	Oral Etoposide therapy resulted in better total FLI-C QOL score than radiotherapy.
T7	Claim 1985 2104	Etoposide resulted in better physical and psychological subscale scores than radiotherapy, 3-drugs and supportive care.
T8	Claim 2105 2259	Thus, funds permitting, oral Etoposide is a pragmatic approach to treating EKS in an environment where antiretroviral drugs are not universally available.
T9	MajorClaim 2260 2406	The study underscores the value of undertaking studies in areas of disease prevalence and the necessity of selecting appropriate outcome measures.
