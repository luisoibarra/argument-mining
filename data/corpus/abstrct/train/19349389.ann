T1	Premise 1165 1362	During follow-up, 71% of the patients showed unaltered or improved lung expansion and 9 patients (15%) needed new pleural procedures (VATS group, 5 recurrences; TS group, 4 recurrences; p = 0.999).
T2	Premise 1363 1489	No differences were found between groups regarding quality of life, complications, drainage time, hospital stay, and survival.
T3	Premise 1490 1640	Immediate lung expansion did not correlate with radiologic recurrence, clinical recurrence, or complications (p = 0.60, 0.15, and 0.20, respectively).
T4	Premise 1641 1728	Immediate partial lung expansion was a frequent finding and was more frequent after TS.
T5	Claim 1742 1835	no correlation between immediate lung expansion and clinical outcome was found in this study.
