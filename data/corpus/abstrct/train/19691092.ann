T1	Premise 928 969	No late arising QOL issues were observed.
T2	Premise 676 766	Regardless of treatment arm, participants reported high levels of QOL with few exceptions.
T3	Premise 767 927	cryoablation was associated with more acute urinary dysfunction (mean PCI urinary function cryoablation=69.4; mean EBRT=90.7; P<.001), which resolved over time.
T4	Premise 970 1168	Both EBRT and cryoablation participants reported decreases in sexual function at 3 months with the cryoablation patients reporting poorer functioning (mean cryoablation=7.2: mean EBRT=32.9; P<.001).
T5	Premise 1169 1341	Mean sexual function score was 15 points lower at 3 years for the cryoablation group and 13% more of the cryoablation men said that sexuality was a moderate or big problem.
T6	Claim 1342 1428	In this randomized trial, no long-term QOL advantage for either treatment was apparent
T7	Claim 1429 1518	with the exception of poorer sexual function reported by those treated with cryoablation.
