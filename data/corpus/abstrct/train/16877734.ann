T1	Claim 1 99	Docetaxel has shown activity in elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
T2	Premise 729 908	There was no statistical difference in median overall survival with docetaxel versus vinorelbine (14.3 months v 9.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.780; 95% CI, 0.561 to 1.085; P = .138).
T3	Premise 909 1016	There was a significant difference in median progression-free survival (5.5 months v 3.1 months; P < .001).
T4	Premise 1017 1124	Response rates were also significantly improved with docetaxel versus vinorelbine (22.7% v 9.9%; P = .019).
T5	Premise 1125 1297	The most common grade 3 to 4 toxicities were neutropenia (82.9% for docetaxel; 69.2% for vinorelbine; P = .031) and leukopenia (58.0% for docetaxel; 51.7% for vinorelbine).
T6	Premise 1298 1354	Other toxicities were mild and generally well tolerated.
T7	Premise 1355 1465	Docetaxel improved overall disease-related symptoms over vinorelbine (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.20).
T8	Premise 1466 1575	Docetaxel improved progression-free survival, response rate, and disease-related symptoms versus vinorelbine.
T9	Claim 1576 1651	Overall survival was not statistically significantly improved at this time.
T10	Claim 1652 1771	Docetaxel monotherapy may be considered as an option in the standard treatment of elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.
