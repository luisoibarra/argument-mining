T1	Premise 1170 1254	We found no difference in severe ARSR between the groups at any point of assessment.
T2	Premise 1019 1169	The incidence of severe ARSR (RTOG/EORTC grade â‰¤2) at the follow-up visit was 23% (n = 45) in the Calendula group and 19% (n = 38) in the Essex group.
T3	Premise 1255 1388	The patients reported low levels of skin related symptoms and no statistically significant differences between the groups were found.
T4	Claim 1389 1478	No differences in ARSR between patients randomised to Calendula or Essex cream was found.
T5	Claim 1479 1638	ARSR seem to be a relatively limited problem, probably more influenced by treatment related factors than by choice of skin care products in this patient group.
