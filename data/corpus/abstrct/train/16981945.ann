T3	MajorClaim 172 262	There is no consensus on an accepted intervention that significantly reduces its severity.
T4	Claim 1216 1377	We could not identify any significant difference in the incidence of severe mucositis based on whether patients were allocated to receive misoprostol or placebo.
T5	Premise 1378 1481	There was no significant difference in the mean area under the mucositis curve (13.2 vs 16.6; P = 0.1).
T6	Premise 1482 1610	Patients allocated to misoprostol did report slightly increased soreness (7.6 vs 6.9; P = 0.04) and a greater use of analgesics.
T7	Premise 1611 1765	However, this difference did not translate into a worse feeling of general well-being as measured by a simple visual analogue scale (5.8 vs 5.2; P = 0.3).
T8	Claim 1766 1885	In conclusion, we were unable to identify a reduction in radiation-induced mucositis in patients receiving misoprostol.
T9	MajorClaim 1886 2115	There is a paucity of high-level evidence on potentially useful interventions and a continued need for new and innovative research, incorporating quality-of-life measurements, in patients experiencing radiation-induced mucositis.
