T1	Premise 831 983	both treatment modalities resulted in significant decrease in the total arm volume (12.2% decrease in Group II and 14.9% decrease in Group I) (p<0.001),
T2	Premise 984 1055	no significant difference (p=0.582) was found between those two groups.
T3	Premise 1056 1194	Similarly, ASES scores were significantly (p=0.001) improved in both Group I and II without any significant difference between the groups.
