T1	Premise 441 598	Overall response was 54% (95% confidence interval [CI] 44.1%-63.9%) with PVI 5-FU + MMC compared to 38% (95% CI: 28.3%-47.7%) for PVI 5-FU alone (P = 0.024).
T2	Premise 599 794	The median failure free survival was 7.9 months in PVI 5-FU plus MMC and 5.4 months with PVI 5-FU alone (P = 0.033) and at one year 31.9% for the combination compared to 17.7% for PVI 5-FU alone.
T3	Premise 795 897	Median survival was 14 months with MMC and 15 months in 5-FU alone; one-year survival 51.7% vs. 57.2%.
T4	Premise 898 1017	PVI 5-FU + MMC caused more overall haematological toxicity but CTC grades 3/4 was increased only for thrombocytopaenia.
T6	Premise 1018 1179	Two patients treated with a cumulative dose of MMC of 40 mg/m2 developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome warranting the reduction in cumulative MMC dose to 28 mg/m2.
T7	Premise 1180 1248	The global QL scores were better for PVI 5-FU + MMC arm at 24 weeks,
T8	Premise 1249 1297	but the remaining QL data showed no differences.
T9	Claim 1298 1469	PVI 5-FU + MMC results in failure-free survival and response advantage, tolerable toxicity and better QL when compared to PVI 5-FU alone but no overall survival advantage.
T10	Premise 1470 1546	There is no irreversible toxicity with MMC at a cumulative dose of 28 mg/m2.
