T1	Premise 713 784	Food intake improved more rapidly after stent placement than after GJJ,
T2	Premise 785 851	but long-term relief of obstructive symptoms was better after GJJ.
T3	Premise 852 985	More major complications (P = 0.02) occurred and more reinterventions were performed (P < 0.01) after stent placement than after GJJ.
T4	Premise 986 1083	Initial costs were higher for GJJ compared to stent placement (euro8315 vs. euro4820, P < 0.001).
T5	Premise 1084 1126	We found no difference in follow-up costs.
T6	Premise 1127 1235	Total costs per patient were higher for GJJ compared to stent placement (euro12433 vs. euro8819, P = 0.049).
T7	Premise 1236 1423	The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GJJ compared to stent placement was euro164 per extra day with a gastric outlet obstruction scoring system (GOOSS) >or=2 adjusted for survival.
T8	Claim 1424 1461	Medical effects were better after GJJ
T9	Claim 1463 1499	although GJJ had higher total costs.
T10	Claim 1569 1688	cost should not play a predominant role when deciding on the type of treatment assigned to patients with malignant GOO.
T11	Claim 1500 1568	Since the cost difference between the two treatments was only small,
