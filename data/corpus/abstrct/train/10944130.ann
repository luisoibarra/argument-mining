T1	Premise 742 893	Complete or partial responses were achieved by 12% of patients treated with IFNalpha2a plus 13-CRA and 6% of patients treated with IFNalpha2a (P =.14).
T2	Premise 894 1106	Median duration of response (complete and partial combined) in the group treated with the combination was 33 months (range, 9 to 50 months), versus 22 months (range, 5 to 38 months) for the second group (P =.03).
T3	Premise 1107 1277	Nineteen percent of patients treated with IFNalpha2a plus 13-CRA were progression-free at 24 months, compared with 10% of patients treated with IFNalpha2a alone (P =.05).
T4	Premise 1278 1402	Median survival time for all patients was 15 months, with no difference in survival between the two treatment arms (P =.26).
T5	Premise 1403 1488	QOL decreased during the first 8 weeks of treatment, and a partial recovery followed.
T6	Premise 1489 1547	Lower scores were associated with the combination therapy.
T7	Claim 1548 1691	Response proportion and survival did not improve significantly with the addition of 13-CRA to IFNalpha2a therapy in patients with advanced RCC.
T8	Claim 1692 1788	13-CRA may lengthen response to IFNalpha2a therapy in patients with IFNalpha2a-sensitive tumors.
T9	Claim 1789 1876	Treatment, particularly the combination therapy, was associated with a decrease in QOL.
