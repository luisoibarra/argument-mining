T1	Premise 701 1000	There were no significant differences between the narrow gastric tube group (NGT group, n=52) and the whole-stomach group (WS group, n=52) with regard to patient and cancer characteristics, operative procedure, postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalisation, and overall survival at 1 year.
T2	Premise 1001 1164	Regarding the postoperative complication, there were more cases of postoperative reflux oesophagitis and impairment of pulmonary function in the WS group (P<0.05).
T3	Premise 1165 1266	Regarding the QoL investigation, the scores of QoL dropped for all patients at 3 weeks after surgery.

T5	Premise 1338 1445	Patients in the NGT group reported significantly (P<0.05) better scores of QoL at both 6 months and 1 year.
