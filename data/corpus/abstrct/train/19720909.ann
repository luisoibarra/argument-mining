T1	MajorClaim 1446 1564	Differences in chemotherapy scheduling, pre-existing morbidity, and toxicity are important in individualizing therapy.
T2	Claim 1324 1396	VC, GC, and TC are not superior to PC in terms of overall survival (OS).
T3	Claim 1397 1445	However, the trend in RR, PFS, and OS favors PC.
T4	Premise 1213 1323	The arms were comparable with respect to toxicity except for leucopenia, neutropenia, infection, and alopecia.
T5	Premise 1118 1212	Response rates (RRs) for PC, VC, GC, and TC were 29.1%, 25.9%, 22.3%, and 23.4%, respectively.
T6	Premise 947 1117	The hazard ratios for progression-free survival (PFS) were 1.36 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.90) for VC, 1.39 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.96) for GC, and 1.27 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.78) for TC.
T7	Premise 784 946	The experimental-to-PC hazard ratios of death were 1.15 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.67) for VC, 1.32 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.92) for GC, and 1.26 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.82) for TC.
