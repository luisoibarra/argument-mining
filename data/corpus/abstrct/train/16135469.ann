T1	Claim 1 146	Evidence suggests that the re-entry phase (ie, early period after medical treatment completion) presents distinct challenges for cancer patients.
T2	Premise 1093 1323	In analyses controlling for study site and baseline depressive symptoms, VID produced significant improvement in energy/fatigue at 6 months relative to CTL, particularly among women who felt less prepared for re-entry at baseline.
T3	Premise 1324 1408	No significant main effect of the interventions emerged on cancer-specific distress,
T4	Premise 1409 1537	but EDU prompted greater reduction in this outcome relative to CTL at 6 months for patients who felt more prepared for re-entry.
T5	Premise 1538 1622	Between-group differences in the primary outcomes were not significant at 12 months,
T6	Premise 1623 1686	and no significant effects emerged on the secondary end points.
T7	Claim 1687 1874	A peer-modeling videotape can accelerate the recovery of energy during the re-entry phase in women treated for breast cancer, particularly among those who feel less prepared for re-entry.
