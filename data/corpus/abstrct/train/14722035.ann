T2	Premise 1169 1236	There was no significant difference in RR, RD, or PFS between arms.
T3	Premise 1237 1343	DPPE plus DOX was statistically superior to DOX in OS (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.91; P =.021).
T4	Premise 1344 1417	DPPE plus DOX was associated with more gastrointestinal and CNS toxicity.
T5	Premise 1418 1462	No consistent influence on QOL was detected.
T6	Claim 1463 1566	This study demonstrated no advantage in RR, RD, or PFS but significantly superior OS for DPPE plus DOX.
T7	Claim 1567 1608	Additional studies of DPPE are warranted.
