T1	Premise 740 896	The most frequent toxic effects were grade 3/4 diarrhea (arm A: 34%, B: 19%), grade 3/4 neutropenia (A: 5%, B: 19%) and grade 2/3 alopecia (A: 26%, B: 65%).
T2	Premise 897 943	Other grade 3/4 toxic effects were rare (<5%).
T3	Premise 944 1057	Response rates were 34% [95% confidence interval (CI) 20% to 51%] in arm A and 35% (95% CI: 20% to 53%) in arm B.
T4	Premise 1058 1209	Median time to progression was 6.9 (4.6-10.1) and 9.2 (7.9-11.5) months and median overall survival was 17.4 (12.6-23.0+) and 24.7 (16.3-26.4+) months.
T5	Premise 1210 1447	Patients with an objective tumor response reported better physical well-being (P < 0.01), mood (P < 0.05), functional performance (P < 0.05) and less effort to cope (P < 0.05) compared with the non-responders and stable disease patients.
T6	Claim 1651 1803	The 3-weekly irinotecan schedule also seemed advantageous in terms of grade 3/4 diarrhea, time to progression, overall survival and patient convenience,
T7	Claim 1804 1877	but the study was not designed to detect differences in these parameters.
T8	Claim 1891 1962	tumor response was shown to have a beneficial effect on QoL indicators.
