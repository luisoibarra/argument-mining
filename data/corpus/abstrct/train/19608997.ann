T1	Premise 764 924	The median overall survival was 10.5 months (placebo) and 10.1 months (thalidomide) (HR for death = 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.93 to 1.27; P = .28).
T2	Premise 925 1060	Among patients with limited-stage disease, there was no evidence of a survival difference (HR for death = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.73 to 1.15),
T3	Premise 1061 1193	but among patients with extensive disease, survival was worse in the thalidomide group (HR for death = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.68).
T4	Premise 1194 1297	Progression-free survival rates were also similar in the two groups (HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.24).
T5	Premise 1298 1505	Thalidomide was associated with an increased risk of having a thrombotic event, mainly pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis (19% thalidomide vs 10% placebo; HR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.41 to 3.20; P < .001).
T6	Premise 1506 1629	There were no statistically significant differences between treatments in hematological and nonhematological toxic effects,
T7	Premise 1630 1714	except more patients in the thalidomide group had rash, constipation, or neuropathy.
T8	Claim 1724 1776	QoL scores were similar in the two treatment groups,
T9	Claim 1777 1888	but thalidomide was associated with less insomnia and diarrhea and more constipation and peripheral neuropathy.
T10	Claim 1921 2076	thalidomide in combination with chemotherapy did not improve survival of patients with SCLC but was associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events.
