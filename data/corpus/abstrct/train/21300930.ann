T1	Premise 837 995	Amenorrhea 12 months after random assignment was significantly different between treatment groups: 69.8% for AC→T, 57.7% for TAC, and 37.9% for AT (P < .001).
T2	Premise 996 1061	The AT group without tamoxifen had the lowest rate of amenorrhea.
T3	Premise 1062 1152	QOL was poorer for patients receiving AC→T at 6 months but similar to others by 12 months.
T4	Premise 1153 1226	Post-treatment symptoms were increased above baseline for all treatments.
T5	Premise 1227 1410	Multivariable repeated measures modeling demonstrated that treatment arm, time point, age, and tamoxifen use were significantly associated with symptom severity (all P values < .002).
T6	Claim 1411 1508	Amenorrhea rates differed significantly by treatment arm, with the AT arm having the lowest rate.
T7	Claim 1509 1684	Patients treated with longer duration therapy (AC→T) had greater symptom severity and poorer QOL at 6 months, but did not differ from shorter duration treatments at 12 months.
