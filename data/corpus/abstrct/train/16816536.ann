T1	Premise 861 922	Two toxicity-related deaths were observed in the Tomudex arm.
T2	Premise 923 1125	The treatments gave rise to different rates of grade 3-4 neutropenia (3, 4, 11 and 14% of the patients in the LV5FU2, ldLV5FU2, HD-FU and Tomudex arms, respectively, p = 0.028), leucopenia and vomiting.
T3	Premise 1126 1294	At least one episode of grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in 27, 25, 38 and 47% of the patients in the LV5FU2, ldLV5FU2, HD-FU and Tomudex arms, respectively (p = 0.016).
T4	Premise 1295 1441	An objective response was observed in 28, 21, 22 and 10% of the patients in the LV5FU2, ldLV5FU2, HD-FU and Tomudex arms, respectively (p = 0.04).
T5	Premise 1442 1637	Progression-free survival (PFS) of the patients in the Tomudex arm was statistically lower compared to that of patients treated with LV5FU2 or ldLV5FU2 (combined group; p = 0.013, log rank test).
T6	Claim 1638 1718	In conclusion, Tomudex is more toxic and yields shorter PFS than infusional 5FU.
T7	Claim 1719 1982	Despite the early closure of the study and the lack of power of the comparison, it seems that ldLV5FU2 could be considered as an active, easier and less expensive option for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer compared to classic LV5FU2 or weekly HD-FU.
