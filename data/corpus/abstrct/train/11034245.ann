T1	MajorClaim 153 238	Intravenous 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin has been a mainstay of chemotherapy,
T2	MajorClaim 243 313	oral 5-FU derivatives have been shown a comparable antitumor activity.
T3	Claim 1 152	Postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation treatment after curative resection for rectal cancer was needed to reduce recurrence and improve a survival rate.
T4	Premise 1354 1453	Mean numbers of chemotherapy cycles were 6.5+/-3.7 (IV arm) vs. 7.2+/-4.3 (oral arm), respectively.
T5	Premise 1454 1566	The rate of recurrence was 9/74 (12.1%) in the IV arm and 6/92 (6.5 %) in the oral arm, respectively (P = .937).
T6	Premise 1567 1681	Local recurrence was 2/74 (stage III; 2.7%) in the IV arm and 1/92 (stage II; 1.1%) in the oral arm, respectively.
T7	Premise 1682 1800	Systemic recurrence was 7/74 (stage III; 9.4%) in the IV arm and 5/92 (stage III; 5.4%) in the oral arm, respectively.
T8	Premise 1801 1859	The most common site of systemic recurrence was the liver.
T9	Premise 1860 1998	Toxicity profile was as follows: leukopenia (30/74 vs. 17/92) and alopecia (21/74 vs. 13/92) were statistically more common in the IV arm.
T10	Premise 1999 2040	Diarrhea was more common in the oral arm.
T11	Premise 2041 2176	Poor quality of life score between two groups was observed at 1 month (23.9% vs. 13%) and 2 months (15.8% vs. 3.7%) after chemotherapy.
T12	Premise 2177 2293	Good quality of life score was observed at 1 month (19.5% vs. 49%) and 2 months (47% vs. 72%), respectively (P<.05).
T13	Claim 2294 2457	Oral doxifluridine with leucovorin shows a comparable therapeutic efficacy to intravenous 5-FU regimen with high quality of life as postoperative adjuvant therapy.
T14	Claim 2458 2543	The oral regimen also can be safely given with appropriate toxicity and tolerability.
