T1	Claim 1746 1858	Cetuximab offers important HRQL and survival benefits for pretreated patients with advanced, wild-type KRAS CRC.
T2	Premise 922 1086	PF change scores were -3.9 for cetuximab and -8.6 for BSC (P = .046) at 8 weeks and were -5.9 and -12.5 for cetuximab and BSC, respectively, (P = .027) at 16 weeks.
T3	Premise 1087 1229	GHS change scores were -0.5 and -7.1 (P = .008) at 8 weeks and were -3.6 and -15.2 (P = .008) at 16 weeks for cetuximab and BSC, respectively.
T4	Premise 1230 1419	In patients who had tumors with wild-type KRAS status, cetuximab resulted in less PF deterioration at 8 weeks (-0.7 v -7.2; P = .11) and 16 weeks (-3.4 v -13.8; P = .008) compared with BSC.
T5	Premise 1420 1587	Patients with wild-type status who received cetuximab experienced improved GHS at 8 weeks, whereas patients who received BSC alone deteriorated (3.2 v -7.7; P = .002).
T6	Premise 1650 1745	No significant differences were noted between study arms for patients with mutated KRAS tumors.
