T1	Claim 1 123	Impaired cognition, fatigue, and diminished quality of life (QOL) are commonly associated with breast cancer chemotherapy.
T2	Premise 945 1041	Mean change in EXIT25 scores from baseline to cycle 4 in the epoetin alfa group was 1.3 +/- 3.3;
T3	Premise 1042 1153	the mean change was 0.3 +/- 2.4 in the placebo group (a negative change indicates improved executive function).
T4	Premise 1154 1270	There was no difference between groups in mean change in EXIT25 score from baseline to 6-month follow-up assessment.
T5	Premise 1271 1395	Mean hemoglobin levels were higher in the epoetin alfa group compared with the placebo group after 4 cycles of chemotherapy.
T6	Premise 1396 1592	Epoetin alfa recipients had less of a decrease in FACT-An subscale scores from baseline to cycle 4 and improvement in FACT-An subscale scores at 6-month follow-up assessment compared with placebo.
T7	Claim 1593 1633	Epoetin alfa therapy was well tolerated.
T8	Claim 1634 1785	These data suggest that epoetin alfa may have attenuated the cognitive impairment and fatigue that occurred during adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy.
