T1	Claim 1 191	Epoetin alfa administered at 40,000 U once weekly (qw) to anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy increases hemoglobin levels, improves quality of life (QOL), and reduces transfusions.
T3	Premise 621 919	At week 12, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An; mean, 2.16 +/- 12.84 for epoetin alfa v -4.43 +/- 13.42 for SOC) and FACT-An fatigue (mean, 1.85 +/- 10.52 for epoetin alfa v -3.55 +/- 11.14 for SOC) change scores were significantly higher in the epoetin alfa group (P < .0001).
T4	Premise 920 1175	Hemoglobin responses defined as mean hemoglobin > or = 12 g/dL or a > or = 2 g/dL increase compared with baseline were significantly higher in the epoetin alfa group versus SOC: 52.0% v 5.1% and 65.7% v 6.3%, respectively (P < .0001 for both comparisons).
T5	Premise 1176 1281	Percentage transfused was significantly lower in the epoetin alfa group compared with SOC (8.6% v 22.9%).
T6	Premise 1282 1371	More than 90% of patients did not require a dose increase and 28.7% had a dose reduction.
T7	Claim 1372 1538	Epoetin alfa administered at 40,000 U qw is effective in improving QOL, maintaining hemoglobin level, and reducing transfusion requirements in breast cancer patients.
T8	Claim 1539 1636	The high effectiveness observed could be attributed in part to early treatment with epoetin alfa.
