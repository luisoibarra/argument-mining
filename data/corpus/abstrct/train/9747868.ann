T1	Premise 872 1096	Tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49% (two-sided P<.00001), with cumulative incidence through 69 months of follow-up of 43.4 versus 22.0 per 1000 women in the placebo and tamoxifen groups, respectively.
T3	Premise 1214 1381	risk was also reduced in women with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ (56%) or atypical hyperplasia (86%) and in those with any category of predicted 5-year risk.
T4	Premise 1382 1464	Tamoxifen reduced the risk of noninvasive breast cancer by 50% (two-sided P<.002).
T5	Premise 1465 1625	Tamoxifen reduced the occurrence of estrogen receptor-positive tumors by 69%, but no difference in the occurrence of estrogen receptor-negative tumors was seen.
T7	Premise 1626 1796	Tamoxifen administration did not alter the average annual rate of ischemic heart disease; however, a reduction in hip, radius (Colles'), and spine fractures was observed.
T9	Premise 1797 1998	The rate of endometrial cancer was increased in the tamoxifen group (risk ratio = 2.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.35-4.97); this increased risk occurred predominantly in women aged 50 years or older.
T11	Premise 2080 2137	no endometrial cancer deaths have occurred in this group.
T12	Premise 2138 2246	No liver cancers or increase in colon, rectal, ovarian, or other tumors was observed in the tamoxifen group.
T13	Premise 2247 2421	The rates of stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis were elevated in the tamoxifen group; these events occurred more frequently in women aged 50 years or older.
T15	Claim 2422 2498	Tamoxifen decreases the incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer.
T16	Claim 2499 2671	Despite side effects resulting from administration of tamoxifen, its use as a breast cancer preventive agent is appropriate in many women at increased risk for the disease.
