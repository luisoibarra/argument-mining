T1	Premise 1061 1289	There was a significant decrease in QoL from baseline (t0) to t1 (RRA period) in the hypothyroid group with significant differences in FACIT-F TOI (P < 10(-3)), FACT-G total score (P = 0.005) and FACIT-F total score (P = 0.003).
T2	Premise 1290 1340	By contrast, QoL was preserved in the rhTSH group.
T3	Premise 1462 1584	From 3 to 9 months, changes of QoL scales and subscales were no longer statistically different in both groups of patients.
T4	Claim 1935 2047	rhTSH preserves QoL of patients undergoing RRA with similar rates of ablation success compared to hypothyrodism.
T5	Premise 1785 1860	A higher rate of persistent thyroid remnants was observed in the rhTSH arm,
T6	Premise 1861 1934	although in most cases uptake was < 0.1% and of no clinical significance.
T7	Premise 1585 1784	Based on serum rhTSH-stimulated Tg alone (Tg < 0.8 microg/l, BRAHMS Tg Kryptor), no difference in ablation success was observed between rhTSH and hypothyroidism groups, 91.7% and 97.1%, respectively.
