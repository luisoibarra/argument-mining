T1	Premise 759 979	Patients allocated to oxaliplatin plus LV5FU2 had significantly longer progression-free survival (median, 9.0 v 6.2 months; P =.0003) and better response rate (50.7% v 22.3%; P =.0001) when compared with the control arm.
T2	Premise 980 1081	The improvement in overall survival did not reach significance (median, 16.2 v 14.7 months; P =. 12).
T3	Premise 1082 1381	LV5FU2 plus oxaliplatin gave higher frequencies of National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria grade 3/4 neutropenia (41. 7% v 5.3% of patients), grade 3/4 diarrhea (11.9% v 5.3%), and grade 3 neurosensory toxicity (18.2% v 0%), but this did not result in impairment of quality of life (QoL).
T4	Premise 1382 1528	Survival without disease progression or deterioration in global health status was longer in patients allocated to oxaliplatin treatment (P =.004).
T5	Claim 1529 1738	The LV5FU2-oxaliplatin combination seems beneficial as first-line therapy in advanced colorectal cancer, demonstrating a prolonged progression-free survival with acceptable tolerability and maintenance of QoL.
