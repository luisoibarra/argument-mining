T1	Premise 1001 1087	A small decline in visual analogue scale scores was observed (70.7 vs. 68.2, P=0.026).
T2	Premise 727 1000	Mean index scores remained stable (0.78 at baseline [n=267], 0.79 at eight weeks [n=186], P=0.34, Wilcoxon signed rank test), attributable to a modest deterioration of physical function domain scores coincident with small improvements in pain and anxiety/depression scores.
T3	Premise 1088 1166	HRQOL changes within chemotherapy response strata revealed stable index scores
T4	Premise 1167 1301	but a trend of worsened physical function among patients with disease progression compared with those with stable or improved disease.
T5	Premise 1302 1502	Visual analogue scale scores trended downward over time irrespective of chemotherapy response status, with a statistically meaningful deterioration in patients who progressed (68.9 vs. 64.4, P=0.029).
T6	Claim 1611 1715	Response to gemcitabine treatment in APC is not associated with appreciable improvement of global HRQOL.
T7	Claim 1805 1898	Those who respond to gemcitabine may experience a slight slowing of functional deterioration.
