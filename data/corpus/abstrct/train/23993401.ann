T1	Premise 778 903	55.6% patients treated over 4 days and 33.3% of patients treated over 11 days experienced acute grade â‰¥ 2 toxicity (p=0.085).
T2	Premise 904 985	Dyspnea, fatigue and coughing domains were worse in the 11 day group at baseline.
T3	Premise 986 1202	At 1 and 4 months, more patients in the 4 day group experienced a clinically meaningful worsening in the dyspnea QOL domain compared to the 11 day group (44.5% vs 15.4%, p=0.02; 38.5% vs 12.0%, p=0.03, respectively).
T4	Premise 1203 1292	However, raw QOL scores were not different at these time-points between treatment groups.
T5	Claim 1293 1399	Grade 2 or higher acute toxicity was more common in the 4 day group, approaching statistical significance.
T6	Claim 1400 1497	More patients treated on 4 consecutive days reported a clinically meaningful increase in dyspnea,
T7	Claim 1498 1605	although interpretation of these results is challenging due to baseline imbalance between treatment groups.
T8	Claim 1606 1660	Larger studies are required to validate these results.
