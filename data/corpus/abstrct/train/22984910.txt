 The aim of this prospective controlled study was to assess the efficacy of two different combination treatment modalities of lymphedema (LE). Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) and compression bandage combination (complex decongestive therapy) have been compared with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) plus self-lymphatic drainage (SLD). Both MLD with compression bandage (complex decongestive therapy) group (Group I, n=15) and IPC with SLD group (Group II, n=15) received treatment for LE 3 days in a week and every other day for 6 weeks. Arm circumferences were measured before and the 1st, 3rd, and 6th weeks of the treatment. EORTC-QLQ and ASES-tests were performed to assess the quality of life before and after 6 week-treatment. Patients in both groups had similar demographic and clinical characteristics. Even though both treatment modalities resulted in significant decrease in the total arm volume (12.2% decrease in Group II and 14.9% decrease in Group I) (p<0.001), no significant difference (p=0.582) was found between those two groups. Similarly, ASES scores were significantly (p=0.001) improved in both Group I and II without any significant difference between the groups. While emotional functioning, fatigue, and pain scores were significantly improved in both groups, global health status, functional and cognitive functioning scores appeared to be improved only in patients of group I. Different treatment modalities consisting of MLD and compression bandage(complex decongestive therapy) or IPC and SLD appear to be effective in the treatment of LE with similar therapeutic efficacy in patients with breast cancer. However, combination modalities including IPC and SLD may be the preferred choices for their applicability at home.
