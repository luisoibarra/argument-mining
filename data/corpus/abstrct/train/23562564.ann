T2	Premise 1249 1348	There was substantial deterioration in QOL scores immediate post-treatment (3-months) in both arms.

T5	Claim 1784 1904	There is substantial deterioration in QOL after curative-intent head-neck irradiation that gradually improves over time.
T6	Claim 1905 2143	IMRT results in clinically meaningful and statistically better QOL scores for some domains compared to 3D-CRT at several time points with comparable disease outcomes that could support its widespread adoption in routine clinical practice.
