T1	Premise 939 1015	There was a trend towards improved global HRQOL during the treatment period.
T2	Premise 1016 1107	At 6 months after the end of RT, global HRQOL was higher in the TPF arm than in the PF arm,
T3	Premise 1108 1177	but the low compliance does not allow to draw definitive conclusions.
T4	Premise 1178 1282	Swallowing and coughing problems decreased more in the TPF arm than in the PF arm at the end of cycle 2,
T5	Premise 1283 1307	but to a limited extent.
T6	Claim 1308 1483	Induction chemotherapy with TPF before RT not only improves survival and reduces toxicity compared with PF but also seems to improve global HRQOL in a more sustainable manner.
