T1	Premise 918 1183	Treatment effects favored castration for both endpoints (P < or = 0.002), with hazard ratios (bicalutamide:castration) of 1.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18 to 2.00) for time to treatment failure and 1.6 (95% CI, 1.19 to 2.15) for time to disease progression.
T2	Premise 1184 1293	From the 1-year survival analysis, the hazard ratio for probability of death was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.72).
T3	Premise 1294 1394	Thus far, with a median follow-up of 86 weeks, median survival has not been reached in either group.
T4	Premise 1395 1586	Changes from baseline in several quality of life variables were significantly different (P < or = 0.01) between treatment groups periodically from months 1 to 6, and all favored bicalutamide.
T6	Premise 1587 1657	Overall, the antiandrogen was well tolerated compared with castration;
T7	Premise 1658 1759	with bicalutamide, hot flushes occurred less often and breast tenderness and gynecomastia more often.
T8	Premise 1760 1849	Although a dosage of 50 mg of bicalutamide once daily was not as effective as castration,
T9	Claim 1850 2030	the favorable quality of life outcomes and the low incidence of nonhormonal adverse events provide reasons to evaluate bicalutamide, as a single therapeutic agent, at higher doses.
