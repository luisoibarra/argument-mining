T1	Premise 745 885	The QLQ-C30 subscales physical function (P=0.044) and constipation (P<0.001) showed an improvement during induction in favour of the MP arm.
T2	Premise 886 1012	During thalidomide maintenance, the scores for the QLQ-MY24 paraesthesia became significantly higher in the MPT arm (P<0.001).
T3	Premise 1013 1187	The QLQ-C30 subscales pain (P=0.12), insomnia (P=0.068), appetite loss (P=0.074) and the QLQ-MY24 item sick (P=0.086) scored marginally better during thalidomide maintenance.
T4	Premise 1188 1357	The overall QoL-scale QLQ-C30-HRQoL showed a significant time trend towards more favourable mean values during protocol treatment without differences between MP and MPT.
T5	Claim 1658 1832	This study shows that the higher frequency of toxicity associated with MPT does not translate into a negative effect on HRQoL and that MPT holds a better patient perspective.
T6	Premise 1358 1657	For the QLQ-C30 subscales emotional function and future perspectives, difference in favour of the MPT arm from the start of treatment was observed (P=0.018 and P=0.045, respectively) with no significant 'time Ã— arm' interaction, indicating a persistent better patient perspective with MPT treatment.
