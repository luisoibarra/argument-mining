T3	Premise 1309 1425	Improvements in self-esteem observed with RET during breast cancer chemotherapy were maintained at 6-month follow-up
T4	Premise 1434 1541	reductions in anxiety not observed with AET during breast cancer chemotherapy emerged at 6-month follow-up.
T5	Premise 1552 1712	adopting a combined aerobic and resistance exercise program after breast cancer chemotherapy was associated with further improvements in patient-rated outcomes.
T6	Claim 1713 1849	Exercise training during breast cancer chemotherapy may result in some longer-term and late effects for selected patient-rated outcomes.
T1	Premise 681 1023	Adjusted linear mixed-model analyses showed that, at 6-month follow-up, the RET group reported higher self-esteem [adjusted mean difference, 1.6; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.1-3.2; P = 0.032] and the AET group reported lower anxiety (adjusted mean difference, -4.7; 95% CI, -0.0 to -9.3; P = 0.049) compared with the usual care group.
T2	Premise 1034 1308	compared with participants reporting no regular exercise during the follow-up period, those reporting regular aerobic and resistance exercise also reported better patient-rated outcomes, including quality of life (adjusted mean difference, 9.5; 95% CI, 1.2-17.8; P = 0.025).
