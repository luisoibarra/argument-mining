T1	Premise 1215 1464	When combined hormone therapy (n=2196) was compared with placebo (n=2189), there was a significant increase in the number of major cardiovascular events (7 v 0, P=0.016) and venous thromboembolisms (22 v 3, hazard ratio 7.36 (95% CI 2.20 to 24.60)).
T2	Premise 1465 1745	There were no statistically significant differences in numbers of breast or other cancers (22 v 25, hazard ratio 0.88 (0.49 to 1.56)), cerebrovascular events (14 v 19, 0.73 (0.37 to 1.46)), fractures (40 v 58, 0.69 (0.46 to 1.03)), and overall deaths (8 v 5, 1.60 (0.52 to 4.89)).
T3	Premise 1746 1871	Comparison of combined hormone therapy (n=815) versus oestrogen therapy (n=826) outcomes revealed no significant differences.
T4	Claim 1872 1993	Hormone replacement therapy increases cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk when started many years after the menopause.
T5	Claim 1994 2111	The results are consistent with the findings of the women's health initiative study and secondary prevention studies.
T6	Claim 2112 2267	Research is needed to assess the long term risks and benefits of starting hormone replacement therapy near the menopause, when the effect may be different.
