 To study the effects of Fuzheng Jianpi Decoction (FJD) combined chemotherapy on the quality of life (QOL) and the survival time of children with solid tumor. Recruited were 167 solid tumor children patients at Department of Tumor, Beijing Children's Hospital. They were randomly assigned to the treatment group (83 cases) and the control group (84 cases) according to the random digit table. All had chemotherapy. Those in the treatment group additionally took FJD, 50 -100 mL each time, twice daily. After chemotherapy those in the treatment group took modified FJD. The WBC, Hb, and PLT were detected in all patients before treatment, 6 months after treatment, and 1 year after treatment. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year QOL, 3-year survival rate, and the survival life of dead children patients were observed. Compared with the control group of the same period, the 6-month and 1-year WBC and Hb increased, the 1-year PLT increased in the treatment group, showing statistical difference (P<0.05, P<0.01). Compared with 1-year treatment in the treatment group, the 2-and 3-year psychological functions and the general symptoms scores decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01). Compared with the control group of the same period, the 2-and 3-year somatic functions, psychological functions, and the general symptoms scores decreased in the treatment group; the 2-year somatic functions and psychological functions decreased in the treatment group; the 3-year psychological functions and the general symptoms scores decreased in the treatment group, all with statistical difference (all P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the death number decreased, the survival rate increased, the life span of dead children was prolonged in the treatment group, showing statistical difference (P<0.05). FJD combined chemotherapy could effectively improve the QOL of solid tumor children patients, elevate their survival rate, and prolong their life spans.
