T1	Premise 793 990	Among the 17 participants with depressive symptoms at baseline, both the Onward and the III-only condition showed large reductions in the depression scale of HADS (d = 1.27 and 0.89, respectively).
T2	Premise 991 1162	Improvement over time and time x treatment effects only reached trend significance levels (ps = 0.07 &amp; 0.12) as this pilot was not powered to detect these differences.
T3	Claim 1163 1337	Both the III + ISG and III-only demonstrated pre-post reductions in depressive symptoms and high rates of utilization compared with other web-based treatments for depression.
T4	Claim 1338 1462	Although it is premature to make any determination as to the efficacy of the interventions tested in this feasibility study,
T5	Claim 1463 1588	these results indicate that pursuing the III + ISG model, as well as standard IIIs, may be fruitful areas of future research.
