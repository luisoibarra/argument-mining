 To observe the effect of TCM therapy for removing toxic substance and unblocking meridians on post-radiation quality of life (QOF) in 55 patients with lung cancer. All patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the 55 patients in the treated group were treated with radiotherapy combined with the TCM therapy, and the 53 in the control group were given radiotherapy alone. The clinical efficacy was evaluated by indexes including KPS scores, QLQ-C30 questionnaire, LC13 specific scale for lung cancer, evaluation criteria for TCM efficacy, the 6-min walking distance, and body weight, etc. The KPS score in the treated group after treatment was improved in 13 patients (23.6%), stabilized in 27 (49.6%) and declined in 15 (27.3%), while in the control group, it was improved in 7 (13.2%), stabilized in 21 (39.6%) and declined in 25 (47.2%), the difference between the two groups was significant (P < 0.05). The results from evaluation with QLQ-C30 questionnaire and LC30 scale in the treated group was also superior to those in the control group (P < 0.05), respectively. The scores of TCM efficacy (24.52 +/- 8.98 vs 29.76 +/- 7.09, P < 0.05) and the 6-min walking distance (233.4 +/- 29.2 m vs 205.8 +/- 31.9 m, P < 0.05) were better in the treated group. After treatment in the treated group, the body weight was increased in 11 patients (20.0%), stabilized in 28 (50.9%) and decreased in 16 (29.1%), while in the control group it was increased in 5 (9.4%), stabilized in 26 (49.1%) and decreased in 22 (41.5%), difference between the two groups was significant, too (P < 0.05). TCM therapy for removing toxic substance and unblocking meridians can improve the post-radiation QOL of patients with lung cancer to some extent.
