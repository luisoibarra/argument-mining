T1	Premise 670 821	In the UAE group, mean ± standard deviation uterine volume was 670 ± 503, 422 ± 353, and 292 ± 287 mL at baseline, 6 months, and 5 years, respectively.
T2	Premise 822 929	Mean dominant fibroid diameter was 7.6 ± 3.0, 5.8 ± 2.9, and 5 ± 2.9 cm at baseline, 6 months, and 5 years.
T3	Premise 930 1037	Fibroid infarction at 6 months was complete in 35 % of women, almost complete in 29 %, and partial in 36 %.
T4	Premise 1038 1125	Need for reintervention was 19, 10, and 33 % in these groups, respectively (p = 0.123).
T5	Premise 1126 1171	No myomectomy cases had further intervention.
T6	Premise 1172 1284	At 5 years, the prevalence of new fibroid was 60 % in the myomectomy group and 7 % in the UAE group (p = 0.008).
T7	Premise 1285 1418	There is a further significant reduction in both uterine volume and dominant fibroid diameter between 6 months and 5 years after UAE.
T8	Claim 1419 1518	Complete fibroid infarction does not translate into total freedom from a subsequent reintervention.
T9	Claim 1519 1582	New fibroid formation is significantly higher after myomectomy.
