T1	Premise 1275 1474	High self-assessed quality of life was reported by 62 (35%) of 179 men allocated radical prostatectomy, 55 (34%) of 160 men assigned to watchful waiting, and 93 (45%) of 208 men in the control group.
T2	Premise 1475 1643	Anxiety was higher in the SPCG-4 groups (77 [43%] of 178 and 69 [43%] of 161 men) than in the control group (68 [33%] of 208 men; relative risk 1·42, 95% CI 1·07-1·88).
T3	Premise 1644 1935	Prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 84% (146 of 173 men) in the radical prostatectomy group, 80% (122 of 153) in the watchful-waiting group, and 46% (95 of 208) in the control group and prevalence of urinary leakage was 41% (71 of 173), 11% (18 of 164), and 3% (six of 209), respectively.
T4	Premise 1936 2088	Distress caused by these symptoms was reported significantly more often by men allocated radical prostatectomy than by men assigned to watchful waiting.
T5	Premise 2089 2444	In a longitudinal analysis of men in SPCG-4 who provided information at two follow-up points 9 years apart, 38 (45%) of 85 men allocated radical prostatectomy and 48 (60%) of 80 men allocated watchful waiting reported an increase in number of physical symptoms; 50 (61%) of 82 and 47 (64%) of 74 men, respectively, reported a reduction in quality of life.
T6	Premise 2445 2564	For men in SPCG-4, negative side-effects were common and added more stress than was reported in the control population.
T7	Claim 2565 2677	In the radical prostatectomy group, erectile dysfunction and urinary leakage were often consequences of surgery.
T8	Claim 2678 2758	In the watchful-waiting group, side-effects can be caused by tumour progression.
T9	Claim 2759 2956	The number and severity of side-effects changes over time at a higher rate than is caused by normal ageing and a loss of sexual ability is a persistent psychological problem for both interventions.
R1	Support Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9	
R2	Support Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9	
T10	Claim 1 108	For men with localised prostate cancer, surgery provides a survival benefit compared with watchful waiting.
