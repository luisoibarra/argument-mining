T1	Premise 941 1071	The mean amount of residual tumor tissue was 28.9% for standard surgery (SS) and 13.8% for surgery involving neuronavigation (SN).
T2	Premise 1072 1181	The corresponding mean amounts of residual contrast-enhancing tumor tissue were 29.2 and 24.4%, respectively.
T3	Premise 1182 1221	These differences were not significant.
T4	Premise 1222 1325	Gross-total removal (GTR) was achieved in five patients who underwent SS and in three who underwent SN.
T5	Premise 1326 1451	Median survival was significantly shorter in the SN group (5.6 months compared with 9 months, unadjusted hazard ratio = 1.6);
T6	Premise 1452 1563	however, this difference may be attributable to the coincidental early death of three patients in the SN group.
T7	Premise 1564 1657	No discernible important effect on the patients' 3-month postoperative course was identified.
T8	Claim 1658 1940	There is no rationale for the routine use of neuronavigation to improve the extent of tumor resection and prognosis in patients harboring a solitary enhancing intracerebral lesion when neuronavigation is not already deemed advantageous because of the size or location of the lesion.
