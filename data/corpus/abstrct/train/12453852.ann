T1	Premise 691 752	The overall response rate was 34.6% for NP and 35.7% for NIP.
T2	Premise 753 868	Median and 1-year survival rates were 10.0 months and 38.4% for NP, and 8.2 months and 33.7% for NIP, respectively.
T3	Premise 923 1219	The major World Health Organization grade 3-4 toxicities for NP and NIP, respectively, were: neutropenia (20.3% compared with 9% of cycles), anaemia (4.1% compared with 5% of cycles), nausea and vomiting (22.2% compared with 19.4% of patients) and alopecia (5.6% compared with 29.8% of patients).
T4	Premise 1220 1286	Four toxic deaths occurred in the NP arm and eight in the NIP arm.
T5	Premise 1287 1422	The different schedules of vinorelbine in the two arms led to a greater survival in the NP arm without impairing the tolerance profile,
T6	Premise 1423 1470	although this is not statistically significant.
T7	Claim 1471 1564	This confirms that the two-drug combination NP is a reference treatment for metastatic NSCLC.
T8	Claim 1565 1649	The role of three-drug combinations remains questionable in this subset of patients.
