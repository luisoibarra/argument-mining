T1	Premise 650 730	Forty-six patients (88%) were in disease remission 12 months after radiotherapy.
T2	Premise 731 969	At 12 months postradiotherapy, 12 (50.0%) and 20 patients (83.3%) in the IMRT group had recovered at least 25% of preradiotherapy SWS and SPS flow respectively, compared with 1 (4.8%) and 2 patients (9.5%), respectively, in the CRT group.
T3	Premise 970 1062	Global health scores showed continuous improvement in QoL after both treatments (p < 0.001).
T4	Premise 1063 1244	However, after 12 months subscale scores for role-physical, bodily pain, and physical function were significantly higher in the IMRT group, indicating a better condition (p < 0.05).
T5	Premise 1245 1327	Dry mouth and sticky saliva were problems in both groups 2 months after treatment.
T6	Premise 1328 1501	In the IMRT group, there was consistent improvement over time with xerostomia-related symptoms significantly less common than in the CRT group at 12 months postradiotherapy.
T7	Claim 1502 1610	IMRT was significantly better than CRT in terms of parotid sparing and improved QoL for early-stage disease.
T8	Claim 1611 1744	The findings support the case for assessment of health-related QoL in relation to head-and-neck cancer using a site-specific approach
