T1	Premise 1131 1246	By cycle 4, mean differences were clinically meaningful for most domains, indicating poorer health status with VMP.
T2	Premise 1247 1345	From cycle 5 onwards, improvements relative to baseline/MP were observed for all domains with VMP.
T3	Premise 1346 1443	Mean scores were generally improved by the end-of-treatment assessment vs. baseline in both arms.
T4	Premise 1444 1622	Among responding patients, mean scores generally improved from time of response to end-of-treatment assessment, substantially driven by patients achieving complete response (CR).
T5	Premise 1623 1766	Multivariate analysis showed a significant impact of duration of response/CR on improving global health status, pain, and appetite loss scores.
T6	Claim 1767 1871	Analyses by bortezomib dose intensity indicated better HRQoL in patients receiving lower dose intensity.
T7	Claim 1872 2075	These findings demonstrate clinically meaningful, transitory HRQoL decrements with VMP and relatively lower HRQoL vs. MP during early treatment cycles, associated with the expected additional toxicities.
T8	Claim 2076 2193	However, HRQoL is not compromised in the long term, recovering by the end-of-treatment visit to be comparable vs. MP.
