T1	Premise 798 1040	In the pamidronate group, the occurrence of hypercalcemia, severe bone pain, and symptomatic impending fractures decreased by 65%, 30%, and 50%, respectively; event-rates of systemic treatment and radiotherapy decreased by 35% (P < or = .02).
T3	Premise 1041 1129	The event-free period (EFP), radiologic course of disease, and survival did not improve.
T4	Claim 1130 1192	Subgroup analyses suggested a dose-dependent treatment effect.
T5	Premise 1193 1349	Compared with their controls, in pamidronate HD/LD patients, events occurred 60% to 90% less frequently (P < or = .03) and the EFP was prolonged (P = .002).
T6	Premise 1350 1429	In pamidronate LD patients, event-rates decreased by 15% to 45% (P < or = .04).
T7	Premise 1430 1498	Gastrointestinal toxicity of pamidronate caused a 23% drop-out rate,
T8	Claim 1499 1573	but other cancer-associated factors seemed to contribute to this toxicity.
T9	Claim 1574 1663	Pamidronate treatment of breast cancer patients efficaciously reduced skeletal morbidity.
T10	Claim 1664 1705	The effect appeared to be dose-dependent.
T11	Claim 1706 1766	Further research on dose and mode of treatment is mandatory.
