T1	Premise 761 847	Overall survival was longer with DCF versus CF (23% risk reduction; log-rank P = .02).
T2	Premise 848 903	Two-year survival rate was 18% with DCF and 9% with CF.
T3	Premise 904 961	Overall response rate was higher with DCF (chi2 P = .01).
T4	Premise 962 1053	Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 69% (DCF) v 59% (CF) of patients.
T5	Premise 1054 1197	Frequent grade 3 to 4 toxicities for DCF v CF were: neutropenia (82% v 57%), stomatitis (21% v 27%), diarrhea (19% v 8%), lethargy (19% v 14%).
T6	Premise 1198 1269	Complicated neutropenia was more frequent with DCF than CF (29% v 12%).
T7	Claim 1270 1419	Adding docetaxel to CF significantly improved TTP, survival, and response rate in gastric cancer patients, but resulted in some increase in toxicity.
T9	Claim 1420 1564	Incorporation of docetaxel, as in DCF or with other active drug(s), is a new therapy option for patients with untreated advanced gastric cancer.
