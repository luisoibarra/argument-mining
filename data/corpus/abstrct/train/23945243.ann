T1	Premise 640 818	For the Pemetrexed group, objective response rate (ORR) was 13.0% (3/23), disease control rate (DCR) was 30.4% (7/23), and median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 3.1 months.
T2	Premise 819 911	In the Gefitinib group, ORR was 17.3% (4/23), DCR was 39.1% (9/23), and mPFS was 4.4 months.
T3	Premise 912 1041	Compared with the Pemetrexed group, the ORR, DCR, and mPFS in the Gefitinib group exhibited no statistical significance (P>0.05).
T4	Premise 1055 1260	the most common toxicities in the Pemetrexed group were neutropenia (n=9, 39.13%) and fatigue (n=8, 34.78%), whereas those in the in Gefitinib group were skin rash (n=8, 34.78%) and diarrhea (n=4, 17.39%).
T5	Premise 1261 1342	Compared with baseline, the QoL improved in both groups but to different degrees.
T6	Premise 1353 1521	emotional, functional well-being, and QoL aspects specifically related to lung cancer were better improved in the Gefitinib group than in the Pemetrexed group (P<0.05).
T7	Claim 1522 1598	The effects of Pemetrexed and Gefitinib as second line therapy were similar,
T8	Premise 1599 1627	although with different AEs.
T9	Claim 1628 1661	Both drugs could improve the QoL,
T10	Claim 1666 1722	Gefitinib showed better overall results than Pemetrexed.
