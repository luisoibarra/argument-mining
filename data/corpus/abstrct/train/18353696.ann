T1	Premise 1005 1064	No differences in pain and symptom intensity were observed.
T3	Premise 1206 1378	At the doses used, methadone was significantly less expensive (p<0.0001), while the use and costs of supportive drugs and other analgesics were similar in the three groups.
T4	Premise 1379 1509	No relevant differences in adverse effects were observed among the groups during either the titration phase and chronic treatment.
T5	Claim 1510 1658	All the three opioids used as first-line therapy were effective, well tolerated, and required similar amounts of symptomatic drugs or co-analgesics.
T2	Premise 1065 1205	Opioid escalation index was significantly lower in patients receiving methadone (p<0.0001), although requiring up and down changes in doses.
T6	Claim 1659 1835	Methadone was significantly less expensive, but required more changes, up and down, of the doses, suggesting that dose titration of this drug requires major clinical expertise.
