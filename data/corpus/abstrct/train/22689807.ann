T1	Premise 1568 1642	Incidence of adverse events was consistent with previously reported rates.
T2	Premise 880 1193	In this updated final analysis of all patients randomly assigned with strata (n = 291), lapatinib plus trastuzumab continued to show superiority to lapatinib monotherapy in PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.94; P = .011) and offered significant OS benefit (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.97; P = .026).
T3	Premise 1194 1327	Improvements in absolute OS rates were 10% at 6 months and 15% at 12 months in the combination arm compared with the monotherapy arm.
T4	Premise 1328 1567	Multiple baseline factors, including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, nonvisceral disease, < three metastatic sites, and less time from initial diagnosis until random assignment, were associated with improved OS.
T5	Claim 1643 1843	These data demonstrated a significant 4.5-month median OS advantage with the lapatinib and trastuzumab combination and support dual HER2 blockade in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-positive MBC.
