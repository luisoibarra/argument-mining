T1	Claim 1435 1501	There was no differences in acute toxicities between the 2 groups.
T2	Claim 1502 1646	Our preliminary data suggest that rhDNase did not significantly improve study primary endpoints of QOL measures compared with the placebo group.
T3	Claim 1656 1826	there was a significant improvement in secondary endpoints of clinically assessed OPS and DNA concentration compared with placebo in H&N cancer patients treated with CRT.
T4	Premise 1264 1324	The rhDNase group showed no change in OPS-DNA concentration,
T5	Premise 1334 1434	the placebo group showed a significant increase in DNA concentration during the drug trial (P=.045).
T6	Premise 1082 1263	Patients in the rhDNase group exhibited significant clinical improvement in OPS, blindly assessed by a physician, compared with the placebo group (67% vs 27%, respectively; P=.046).
T7	Premise 896 1081	Similarly, both groups showed a decline in physical and functional well being but recovered in the 3 months posttreatment follow-up, with the rhDNase group exhibiting speedier recovery.
T8	Premise 715 781	Both groups showed an increase in symptom and interference scores,
T9	Premise 791 895	patients in the rhDNase group showed a greater decline in both scores during the 3 months posttreatment.
