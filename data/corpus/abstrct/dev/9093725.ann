T1	MajorClaim 1 218	The extent to which chemotherapy may relieve tumour-related symptoms, improve quality of life and prolong survival in patients with gastric cancer is not known in spite of the extensive use of this treatment modality.
T2	Premise 865 1075	More patients in the chemotherapy group (45%, 14/31) had an improved or prolonged high quality of life for a minimum period of 4 months compared to those in the best supportive care group (20%, 6/30, P < 0.05).
T3	Premise 1076 1280	A similar difference was seen in the treating physician's evaluation of whether the patient was subjectively improved or continued to do well for at least 4 months (17/31, 55% versus 6/30, 20%, P < 0.01).
T4	Premise 1281 1358	Overall survival was longer in the chemotherapy group (median 8 vs. 5 months)
T5	Premise 1359 1428	although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.12).
T6	Premise 1429 1579	After corrections for imbalances in pretreatment characteristics, chemotherapy treatment was, however, associated with a survival benefit (P = 0.003).
T7	Premise 1580 1739	Also, the quality-adjusted survival time and time to disease progression were longer for patients randomized to chemotherapy (median 5 vs. 2 months, P = 0.03).
T8	Claim 1740 1847	The results show that chemotherapy can add to both quantity and quality of life in advanced gastric cancer.
T9	Claim 1848 1932	The number of patients who benefit from treatment is, however, still rather limited.
