T1	Premise 1098 1180	There was no difference in overall or cancer-specific survival between the 2 arms.
T2	Premise 1181 1276	There was no statistically significant difference in QOL between the 2 arms at 0 and 12 months.
T3	Premise 1277 1434	The total mean costs at 24 months were significantly lower in the intermittent arm ($3135 vs. $8253 Canadian dollars, P=0.0167) compared with the continuous.
T4	Premise 1435 1494	The main limitation of this study is the small sample size.
T5	Claim 1495 1722	We have observed that intermittent ADT in patients with CRPCa, using a testosterone of >1.75 ngmol/L as a trigger to reinitiate LHRHa, results in a substantial cost savings with no negative impact on oncologic and QOL outcomes.
