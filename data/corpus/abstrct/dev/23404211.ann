T1	Premise 755 892	Treatment with EVE + EXE significantly improved median PFS versus PBO + EXE among Asian patients by 38 % (HR = 0.62; 95 % CI, 0.41-0.94).
T2	Premise 893 987	Median PFS was also improved among non-Asian patients by 59 % (HR = 0.41; 95 % CI, 0.33-0.50).
T3	Premise 988 1149	Median PFS duration among EVE-treated Asian patients was 8.48 versus 4.14 months for PBO + EXE, and 7.33 versus 2.83 months, respectively, in non-Asian patients.
T4	Premise 1150 1328	The most common grade 3/4 adverse events (stomatitis, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, hyperglycemia, and dyspnea) occurred at similar frequencies in Asian and non-Asian patients.
T5	Premise 1329 1408	Grade 1/2 interstitial lung disease occurred more frequently in Asian patients.
T6	Premise 1409 1478	Quality of life was similar between treatment arms in Asian patients.
T7	Claim 1479 1601	Adding EVE to EXE provided substantial clinical benefit in both Asian and non-Asian patients with similar safety profiles.
T8	Claim 1602 1803	This combination represents an improvement in the management of postmenopausal women with HR(+)/HER2(-) advanced breast cancer progressing on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors, regardless of ethnicity.
