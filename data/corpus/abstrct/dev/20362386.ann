T1	Premise 1356 1648	For intervention and control groups respectively, mean catheter duration was 11.74 d and 12.74 d (p=0.451); leakage on cystogram was present in six and eight cases (p=0.28); and incontinence (any involuntary urine loss) at 3 mo was 75% and 69% (p=0.391) and at 6 mo was 51% and 43% (p=0.686).
T2	Premise 1649 1709	Urinary retention occurred only in one case (control group).
T3	Premise 1710 1836	The percentage of cases returning to baseline in all QoL domains (except insomnia) was similar at 6 mo between the two groups.
T4	Premise 1837 2006	Short follow-up, lack of blinding, and probable small differences in our method of MFRR performed compared with other studies were identified as significant limitations.
T5	Premise 2007 2086	No significant difference in any of the analysed outcome measures was observed.
T6	Claim 2087 2207	Posterior reconstruction of the musculofascial complex does not appear to improve early urinary incontinence after RALP.
