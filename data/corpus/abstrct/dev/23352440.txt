 Quality of life (QoL) after breast cancer is nowadays a major challenge. Complementary interventions are necessary because of frequent depression symptoms after treatment and also to favour return to activity. Besides, radio-chemotherapy has side-effects like weight gain and fatigue. Several strategies including group behavioural-educational interventions, physical training and/or dietary education, have been tested to answer these difficulties with moderate success in the long run. Two hundred and fifty-one non-metastatic patients were accrued after chemotherapy in a prospective randomised multicenter trial between 2008 and 2010, testing a 2-week intervention in SPA centres. Intervention comprised group physical training, dietary education and physiotherapy. Selected patients were in complete remission. QoL was evaluated with SF36 questionnaire, anxiety and depression with the hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) one. Anthropometric measures and QoL evaluations were obtained before randomisation and every 6 months during 3 years. Two hundred and twenty patients were evaluable at 1 year. Intervention increased SF36 score by 9.5 points (p=0.000006), 4.6 (p=0.032) and 6.2 (p=0.028) respectively at 6, 12 and 24 months. Effect size (ES) was 0.63 [0.37; 0.90], 0.29 [0.03; 0.55] and 0.41 [0.04; 0.78]. Anxiety score was shortly minored by intervention (6-month ES=-0.24 [-0.42; -0.05]) and depression score more durably: ES=-0.45 [-0.72; -0.18], -0.34 [-061; -0.08], and -0.26 [-0.63; 0.11] at 6, 12 and 24 months. This 2-week group intervention seemed to durably influence QoL of breast cancer patients treated by chemotherapy. Differences, smaller at 12 months than at six, suggest that a second but shorter intervention could help maintain the 6-month benefits.
