 The role of chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC patients and ECOG PS2 remains controversial. We evaluated 4 doses of 3-weekly docetaxel to identify a less toxic, clinically effective dose. Seventy-three patients with stage III (22%) (unsuitable for radical surgery/radiotherapy) and IV (78%) NSCLC were randomized to receive 4 doses of 3-weekly docetaxel, for 4 cycles: arm (A) 40 mg/m(2) (n=17), arm (B) 50 mg/m(2) (n=17), arm (C) 60 mg/m(2) (n=19), arm (D) 50 mg/m(2) escalated by 10 mg/m(2) to a maximum of 70 mg/m(2) (n=19). Primary endpoints: maximum tolerated dose, RR, duration of response, symptom improvement, toxicity and QoL. Secondary endpoint: overall survival (OS). Patients and disease characteristics were well balanced. Median age was 67 (range 45-81), there were 32 male and 41 female, histology subtype: squamous/adenocarcinoma/mixed/NOS=42%/49%/4%/5%. Seven patients did not receive any treatment because of deterioration in PS or death. 50% of patients in arm D, who received more than one cycle, received dose escalation. There was no statistical difference in the number of cycles administered (arms A, B and D: median 2 cycles and arm C: median 3 cycles) and no difference in RR: arm A=6%, arm B=6%, arm C=10%, and arm D=0%. There was no statistically significant difference in grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia between the four arms. No difference was observed in hospitalization rate, blood transfusions, antibiotics administration and non-haematological toxicity. QoL: no difference in total scores between baseline and cycles 1-4. There was a significant decrease in pain scores from baseline to post cycles 2 and 3 (p=0.025 and p=0.002, respectively). There was no difference in OS (p=0.992). Median survival and 6-month survival were 61, 86, 88 and 97 days and 29%, 33%, 21% and 26% for arms A, B, C, and D, respectively. Clinical efficacy of docetaxel was observed at all dose levels. Higher dose levels were not associated with increased toxicities, use of IV antibiotics or hospitalization rates. However, the median survival observed is shorter than historical data and do not support further evaluation of these doses of single agent docetaxel in this population.
