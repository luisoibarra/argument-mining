T1	Claim 1 190	In a randomized clinical trial in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), infusion with adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) inhibited loss of body weight and quality of life.
T2	Premise 894 1205	No change in body composition over the 28-week follow-up period was found in the ATP group, whereas, per 4 weeks, the control group lost 0.6 kg of FM (P =.004), 0.5 kg of FFM (P =.02), 1.8% of arm muscle area (P =.02), and 0.6% of BCM/kg body weight (P =.054) and decreased 568 KJ/d in energy intake (P =.0001).
T3	Premise 1206 1313	Appetite also remained stable in the ATP group but decreased significantly in the control group (P =.0004).
T4	Premise 1314 1397	No significant differences in REE between the ATP and control groups were observed.
T5	Claim 1398 1567	The inhibition of weight loss by ATP infusions in patients with advanced NSCLC is attributed to counteracting the loss of both metabolically active and inactive tissues.
T6	Premise 1568 1634	These effects are partly ascribed to maintenance of energy intake.
