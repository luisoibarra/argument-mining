T1	Premise 1110 1237	After 1 mo, 44.1% (26 of 59) of patients were continent in group A, while 20.3% (12 of 59) were continent in group B (p=0.018).
T2	Premise 1238 1356	At 3 mo, 59.3% (35 of 59) and 37.3% (22 of 59) patients were continent in group A and group B, respectively (p=0.028).
T3	Premise 1357 1512	The ICS male SF mean score showed better results in group A than in group B patients at both 1 mo (14.6 vs 18.3) and 3 mo (8.1 vs 12.2) after RP (p=0.002).
T4	Premise 1513 1734	In age-adjusted logistic regression analyses, patients who performed preoperative PFME had a 0.41-fold lower risk of being incontinent 1 mo after RP and a 0.38-fold lower risk of being incontinent 3 mo after RP (pâ‰¤0.001).
T5	Claim 1735 1808	Preoperative PFME may improve early continence and QoL outcomes after RP.
T6	Claim 1809 1863	Further studies are needed to corroborate our results.
