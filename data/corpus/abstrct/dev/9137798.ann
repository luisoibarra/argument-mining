T1	Premise 747 987	Patients receiving MA reported substantially better appetite (P = 0.001), mood (P = 0.001) and overall quality of life (P < 0.001), and possibly less nausea and vomiting (P = 0.08) than patients receiving placebo, based on a test for trend.
T2	Premise 988 1184	A larger benefit was seen with the higher dose which (unlike the lower dose) was significantly better in pairwise comparisons with placebo for appetite, mood and overall QoL (each P < or = 0.001).
T3	Premise 1185 1346	Despite some missing data on QoL scores, QoL ranking was available on 227 (95%) of patients with significantly higher QoL ranking associated with MA (P = 0.002).
T4	Premise 1347 1419	Improvements in QoL occurred early within four weeks and were sustained.
T5	Premise 1420 1523	No statistically significant differences were observed in NS measurements, including weight (P = 0.29).
T6	Premise 1524 1610	Side effects of therapy were minor and did not differ significantly across treatments.
T7	Claim 1611 1725	Megestrol acetate given at 480 mg/day is useful palliation in patients with endocrine-insensitive advanced cancer.
T8	Claim 1726 1799	It improves appetite, mood and overall quality of life in these patients,
T9	Claim 1800 1859	although not through a direct effect on nutritional status.
