T1	Premise 1257 1363	The most favorable effect was observed in patients with low hepatic tumor load and resected primary tumor.
T2	Premise 1364 1455	Seven and nine deaths were observed in the octreotide LAR and placebo groups, respectively.
T3	Premise 1456 1516	The HR for overall survival was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.30 to 2.18).
T4	Claim 1517 1677	Octreotide LAR significantly lengthens time to tumor progression compared with placebo in patients with functionally active and inactive metastatic midgut NETs.
T5	Premise 1678 1763	Because of the low number of observed deaths, survival analysis was not confirmatory.
T6	Premise 873 1045	Median time to tumor progression in the octreotide LAR and placebo groups was 14.3 and 6 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.59; P = .000072).
T7	Premise 1046 1195	After 6 months of treatment, stable disease was observed in 66.7% of patients in the octreotide LAR group and 37.2% of patients in the placebo group.
