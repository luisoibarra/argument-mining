T1	Premise 913 1057	Median MFD time was reduced in the ERP group (3 days versus 6 days with standard care; P < 0·001), as was LOS (4 days versus 7 days; P < 0·001).
T2	Premise 1058 1156	The ERP significantly reduced the rate of medical complications (7 versus 27 per cent; P = 0·020),
T3	Premise 1157 1312	but not surgical complications (15 versus 11 per cent; P = 0·612), readmissions (4 versus 0 per cent; P = 0·153) or mortality (both 2 per cent; P = 0·987).
T4	Premise 1313 1384	QoL over 28 days was significantly better in the ERP group (P = 0·002).
T5	Premise 1385 1433	There was no difference in patient satisfaction.
T6	Claim 1434 1495	ERPs for open liver resection surgery are safe and effective.
T7	Claim 1496 1627	Patients treated in the ERP recovered faster, were discharged sooner, and had fewer medical-related complications and improved QoL.
