 To evaluate the difference of efficacy, side-effects and quality of life in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with oxaliplatin plus vinorelbine or cisplatin plus vinorelbine. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to NL (oxaliplatin + vinorelbine) group and NP (cisplatin + vinorelbine) group in a 2:1 ratio. In the NL group, 70 evaluable cases were treated with oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) i.v. on day 2, and vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) i.v. on days 1 and 8 in 21 days per cycle. In the NP group, 32 evaluable cases were treated with cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) i.v. divided to 2 - 3 days dosing, 21 days per cycle, and vinorelbine administered by the same way as in the NL group. The response rate, time to progression (TTP), one-year survival, side-effects and the quality of life were observed. The response rate was 35.7% vs. 43.8% (P = 0.4), median TTP was 4.7 months vs. 5.5 months (P = 0.6), one-year survival rate was 38.5% vs. 58.6% (P = 0.07) in the NL and NP groups, respectively. Grade I-II neuro-sensory toxicity occurred significantly more frequent in NL group than in NP group (68.4% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.0017). However, Grade I-II granulocytopenia was significantly less occurred in NL group than in NP group (49.4% vs. 70.6%, P = 0.037). There was no statistically difference between the two groups regarding quality of life. Due to good efficacy and tolerability, the NL regimen offered a new candidate for treating advanced NSCLC.
