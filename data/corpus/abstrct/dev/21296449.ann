T1	Premise 1687 1727	There was no difference in OS (p=0.992).
T2	Premise 1565 1686	There was a significant decrease in pain scores from baseline to post cycles 2 and 3 (p=0.025 and p=0.002, respectively).
T3	Premise 1365 1496	No difference was observed in hospitalization rate, blood transfusions, antibiotics administration and non-haematological toxicity.
T4	Premise 1041 1245	There was no statistical difference in the number of cycles administered (arms A, B and D: median 2 cycles and arm C: median 3 cycles) and no difference in RR: arm A=6%, arm B=6%, arm C=10%, and arm D=0%.
T5	Premise 1246 1364	There was no statistically significant difference in grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia between the four arms.
T6	Premise 1728 1857	Median survival and 6-month survival were 61, 86, 88 and 97 days and 29%, 33%, 21% and 26% for arms A, B, C, and D, respectively.
T7	Claim 1858 1921	Clinical efficacy of docetaxel was observed at all dose levels.
T8	Claim 1922 2035	Higher dose levels were not associated with increased toxicities, use of IV antibiotics or hospitalization rates.
T9	Premise 2045 2204	the median survival observed is shorter than historical data and do not support further evaluation of these doses of single agent docetaxel in this population.
