T1	Claim 1959 2056	This may lead to reduced distress and fatigue, and consequently improved QoL of cancer survivors.
T2	Claim 1863 1958	In addition to physical activity, future interventions should target self-efficacy and mastery.
T3	Claim 1670 1862	The beneficial effect of group-based physical exercise on QoL was mediated by increased physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery, and subsequent reductions in fatigue and distress.

T4	Premise 1569 1669	increased physical activity was directly associated with improved QoL (β = 3.37, 95%CI = 1.01;5.54).
T5	Premise 1425 1559	Reductions in fatigue (β = -1.33, 95%CI =-1.85;-0.83) and distress (β = -0.86, 95%CI = -1.25;-0.52) were associated with improved QoL.
T6	Premise 1196 1424	The intervention had a borderline significant direct effect on reduced distress (β = -1.32, 95%CI = -2.68;0.11), and a significant indirect effect via increased general self-efficacy and mastery (β = -1.06, 95%CI = -1.89;-0.38).
T7	Premise 939 1195	the intervention had both a direct effect on fatigue (β = -1.09, 95%CI = -2.12;0.01), and an indirect effect (β = -0.54, 95%CI = -1.00;-0.21) via physical activity (β = -0.29, 95%CI = -0.64;-0.07) and general self-efficacy (β = -0.25, 95%CI = -0.61;-0.05).
T8	Premise 715 929	The intervention was associated with increased physical activity (β = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14;0.59), general self-efficacy (β = 2.41, 95%CI = 0.35;4.73), and mastery (β = 1.75, 95%CI = 0.36;2.78).
