T1	Claim 1 107	Older patients, even if fit, are often considered incapable of tolerating platinum-based systemic therapy.
T2	Premise 811 957	Older patients had a higher incidence of cardiovascular (P =.009) and respiratory (P =.04) comorbidities and nonanalgesic medication use (P =.02).
T3	Premise 958 1070	Leukopenia (P<.001) and neuropsychiatric toxicity (P =.002) were more common in elderly men than in younger men.
T4	Premise 1071 1131	Elderly women lost more weight than younger women (P =.006).
T5	Premise 1196 1618	The proportions with clinical partial or complete response (21.5% versus 23.3%; Fisher's exact test, P =.66), median time to progression (4.37 versus 4.30 months; log-rank test, P =.29), and survival distribution (log-rank test, P =.29; median survival, 9.05 versus 8.53 months; 1-year survival, 38% versus 29%; and 2-year survival, 14% versus 12%) were similar in patients younger than 70 years and 70 years old or older.
T6	Premise 1619 1687	Baseline quality-of-life and treatment-outcome indices were similar.
T7	Premise 1688 1767	Equivalent declines over time in functional well-being occurred in both groups.
T8	Claim 2049 2116	Advanced age alone should not preclude appropriate NSCLC treatment.
T9	Claim 1768 1922	Response rate, toxicity, and survival in fit, elderly NSCLC patients receiving platinum-based treatment appear to be similar to those in younger patients,
T10	Claim 1923 2048	although patients 70 years old or older have more comorbidities and can expect more leukopenia and neuropsychiatric toxicity.
