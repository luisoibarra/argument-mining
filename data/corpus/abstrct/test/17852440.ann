T1	Claim 1 144	Patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer often develop anemia, which can contribute to increased morbidity and reduced quality of life (QOL).
T2	Claim 145 249	Chemotherapy-induced anemia can be successfully treated using recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO).
T3	Premise 1335 1494	Among the 30 patients evaluable for hematologic response, the mean increase in Hb from baseline to time of final evaluation was 3.08 +/- 1.48 g/dl (p < 0.001).
T4	Premise 1495 1657	An increase in Hb of > or = 2 g/dl, in the absence of blood transfusion, occurred in 70% of patients (21 of 30 patients) who were on the study for > or = 30 days.
T5	Premise 1658 1797	The overall response rate (Hb increase > or = 2 g/dl or Hb > or = 12 g/dl in the absence of blood transfusion) was 90% (27 of 30 patients).
T6	Premise 1798 2082	In 30 patients who were evaluable for QOL assessment, epoetin-alpha therapy was found to significantly (p < 0.001) improve mean cancer linear analog scale (CLAS) scores for energy level, ability to perform daily activity, and overall QOL from baseline to the time of final evaluation.
T7	Premise 2083 2131	QW epoetin-alpha was found to be well tolerated.
T8	Claim 2132 2335	Treatment with QW epoetin-alpha was found to increase Hb levels, decrease transfusion requirement, and improve functional status and QOL in anemic patients with ALL in maintenance receiving chemotherapy.
T9	Claim 2336 2498	The once-weekly schedule is convenient, safe, and may reduce the burden on patients, parents, and their caregivers by reducing the number of visits to the clinic.
