T1	MajorClaim 1 164	Research suggests that stress-reduction programs tailored to the cancer setting help patients cope with the effects of treatment and improve their quality of life.
T3	Premise 1059 1234	Patients in the TY group reported significantly lower sleep disturbance scores during follow-up compared with patients in the wait-list control group (5.8 vs. 8.1; P < 0.004).
T4	Premise 1235 1405	This included better subjective sleep quality (P < 0.02), faster sleep latency (P < 0.01), longer sleep duration (P < 0.03), and less use of sleep medications (P < 0.02).
T5	Premise 1406 1533	There were no significant differences between groups in terms of intrusion or avoidance, state anxiety, depression, or fatigue.
T6	Claim 1534 1693	The participation rates suggested that a TY program is feasible for patients with cancer and that such a program significantly improves sleep-related outcomes.
