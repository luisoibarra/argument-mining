T1	Claim 1546 1691	PPX/carboplatin failed to provide superior survival compared with paclitaxel/carboplatin in the first-line treatment of PS 2 patients with NSCLC,
T2	Claim 1692 1827	but the results with respect to progression-free survival and overall survival were comparable and the PPX regimen was more convenient.
T3	Premise 811 1002	Alopecia, arthralgias/myalgias, and cardiac events were significantly less frequent with PPX/carboplatin, whereas grade > or =3 neutropenia and grade 3 neuropathy showed a trend of worsening.
T4	Premise 1003 1146	There was no significant difference in the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions despite the absence of routine premedication in the PPX arm.
T5	Premise 1147 1240	Overall survival was similar between treatment arms (hazard ratio, 0.97; log rank p = 0.769).
T6	Premise 1241 1346	Median and 1-year survival rates were 7.9 months and 31%, for PPX versus 8 months and 31% for paclitaxel.
