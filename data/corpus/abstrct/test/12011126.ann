T1	Premise 818 1065	Transfusion-free (P =.0012) survival and transfusion- and severe anemia-free survival (P =.0001) were significantly greater in the epoetin beta group versus placebo (Wald chi(2) test), giving a relative risk reduction of 43% and 51%, respectively.
T2	Premise 1066 1170	The response rate was 67% and 27% in the epoetin beta versus the placebo group, respectively (P <.0001).
T3	Premise 1171 1291	After 12 and 16 weeks of treatment, QOL significantly improved in the epoetin beta group compared with placebo (P <.05);
T4	Premise 1292 1373	this improvement correlated with an increase in Hb concentration (> or = 2 g/dL).
T5	Claim 1447 1674	Many severely anemic and transfusion-dependent patients with advanced MM, NHL, and CLL and a low performance status benefited from epoetin therapy, with elimination of severe anemia and transfusion need, and improvement in QOL.
