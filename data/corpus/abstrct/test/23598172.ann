T1	Premise 1104 1286	Median overall survival was 20.1 months (95% CI 16.7-23.4) with axitinib and 19.2 months (17.5-22.3) with sorafenib (hazard ratio [HR] 0.969, 95% CI 0.800-1.174; one-sided p=0.3744).
T2	Premise 1287 1457	Median investigator-assessed PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI 6.7-9.2) with axitinib and 5Â·7 months (4.7-6.5) with sorafenib (HR 0.656, 95% CI 0.552-0.779; one-sided p<0.0001).
T3	Premise 1458 1574	Patient-reported outcomes scores were similar in the treatment groups at baseline, were maintained during treatment,
T4	Premise 1575 1609	but decreased at end-of-treatment.
T5	Premise 1610 1894	Common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (60 [17%]), diarrhoea (40 [11%]), and fatigue (37 [10%]) in 359 axitinib-treated patients and hand-foot syndrome (61 [17%]), hypertension (43 [12%]), and diarrhoea (27 [8%]) in 355 sorafenib-treated patients.
T6	Premise 1895 2306	In a post-hoc 12-week landmark analysis, median overall survival was longer in patients with a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater than in those with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg: 20.7 months (95% CI 18.4-24.6) versus 12.9 months (10.1-20.4) in the axitinib group (p=0.0116), and 20.2 months (17.1-32.0) versus 14.8 months (12.0-17.7) in the sorafenib group (one-sided p=0.0020).
T7	Claim 2409 2507	investigator-assessed PFS remained longer in the axitinib group compared with the sorafenib group.
T8	Claim 2508 2625	These results establish axitinib as a second-line treatment option for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
