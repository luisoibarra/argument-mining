T1	MajorClaim 1 52	Morbidity is an important issue in cancer research.
T2	Claim 53 241	The observer-based toxicity scoring system used by DAHANCA (the Danish head and neck cancer study group) has proved itself sensitive to differences in toxicity in a large randomised study,
T3	Claim 242 317	but like other toxicity scoring systems it has not been formally validated.
T4	Premise 1075 1172	The DAHANCA toxicity scoring system and the EORTC QLQ correlated with several clinical endpoints.
T5	Premise 1173 1252	The conceptually similar endpoints of the two methods correlated significantly.
T6	Premise 1253 1380	The objective endpoints of the DAHANCA scoring system were only correlated with quality of life endpoints to a very low degree.
T7	Premise 1381 1594	The DAHANCA toxicity scores had a low sensitivity (0.48-0.74) in detecting equivalent subjective complaints from the questionnaires and the observer-based scoring system severely underestimated patient complaints.
T8	Premise 1595 1696	A specific patient group where the DAHANCA score had a higher tendency to fail could not be detected.
T9	Claim 1697 1920	The DAHANCA toxicity score is an effective instrument in assessing objective treatment induced toxicity in head and neck cancer patients but insensitive and non-specific with regard to patient assessed subjective endpoints.
T11	Claim 1921 2045	This weakness seems inherent in an observer-based scoring system, and will probably also apply to newer ones like CTCAE 3.0.
