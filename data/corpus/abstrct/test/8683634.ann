T1	MajorClaim 1 324	Combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy after surgery, compared with postsurgical radiation therapy alone, has been shown to improve disease-free survival and overall survival significantly among patients with poor-prognosis (i.e., advanced stage disease or metastasis to regional lymph nodes) resectable rectal cancer.
T2	Claim 325 517	However, the combined therapy is associated with more toxic effects, raising the question of whether the benefits of the treatment justify its quality-of-life costs for the individual patient.
T3	Premise 1326 1580	As reported previously, the combined therapy reduced the risk of relapse by 34% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 12%-50%; P = .0016) and reduced the overall death rate by 29% (95% CI = 7%-45%; P = .025) in comparison with adjuvant radiation therapy alone.
T4	Premise 1581 1935	In the 5 years following assignment to treatment, patients who received the combined therapy had more time with toxicity (3.1 months; 95% CI = 2.0-4.1 months), shorter survival after relapse (3.6 months less; 95% CI = 0.9-6.3 months less), and more TWiST (6.1 months; 95% CI = 0.2-12.0 months) than patients who received adjuvant radiation therapy alone.
T5	Claim 1936 2250	Despite an increase in the amount of time that individuals spent with early and late toxic effects, the Q-TWiST analysis indicated that the combined therapy conferred significantly greater benefit for a wide range of patient preferences about living with the toxicity of treatment or the symptoms of overt disease.
T6	Claim 2251 2399	Use of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy as an adjuvant to surgery for patients with poor-prognosis resectable rectal cancer is justified,
T7	Premise 2400 2539	since the improved outcome in terms of delayed recurrence and increased survival balances the time spent with early and late toxic effects.
T8	Claim 2540 2653	The Q-TWiST method is an excellent way to compare treatment outcomes that include quality-of-life considerations.
