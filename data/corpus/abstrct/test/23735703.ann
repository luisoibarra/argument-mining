T1	Premise 1113 1167	Although quality of life did not differ significantly,
T2	Premise 1168 1234	chemotherapy compliance was significantly higher in the PRE group.
T3	Premise 1018 1112	Pathological complete response was observed in 22 (8.2%) and 16 patients (6.1%), respectively.
T4	Premise 1235 1364	The proportion of responders who received Cycles 3 and 4 was significantly higher in the PRE group (90.4% versus 75.2%, p=0.001).
T5	Premise 1365 1545	In responders, the dose intensity of Cycles 3 and 4 was higher in the PRE group than in the PERI group (mean relative dose intensity of 90.4% versus 82.6%, respectively; p=0.0007).
T6	Premise 1546 1679	There was no difference between GP and TC in 3-year OS (HR=0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76-1.25], p=0.80) or response rates.
T7	Premise 1689 1730	the regimens' toxicity profiles differed.
T8	Claim 1731 1883	This study failed to demonstrate any difference in survival between patients receiving preoperative and perioperative chemotherapy in early-stage NSCLC.
T9	Claim 1884 1995	The increase from two to four preoperative chemotherapy cycles did not increase the pathological response rate.
