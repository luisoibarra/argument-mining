 Patients undergoing gastrectomy because of stomach cancer often face weight loss in the perioperational period, which can lead to malnutrition and negative treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to develop a patient participation-based dietary intervention (PPDI) and evaluate its effects on patient outcomes. This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial in which the patients were recruited in a cancer center in South Korea. The participants (N = 56), who underwent gastrectomy with stomach cancer stage I to III, were randomly assigned into either the experimental or the control group. The PPDI, which was given on the day before the hospital discharge, comprised 2 face-to-face and 2 telephone interventions. The outcome variables included body weight, body mass index, muscle mass, the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment, Dietary Symptom Scale, Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-General, Karnofsky Performance Status, Adherence to Dietary Guidelines Scale, Scale of Dietary Knowledge, Patient Satisfaction Scale, and a 3-day food diary. Participants in the PPDI intervention demonstrated significant (P < .05) reductions in adverse dietary symptoms and significant improvements (P < .05) in functional status, performance status, dietary intake, adherence to dietary guidelines, dietary knowledge, and satisfaction with the intervention as compared with the control group over time. The PPDI was an effective dietary intervention for patients undergoing a gastrectomy for gastric cancer and deserves additional study in other populations of patients. Incorporating patients' perspectives into a dietary intervention after gastrectomy for gastric cancer may contribute to improved patient outcomes and quality care.
