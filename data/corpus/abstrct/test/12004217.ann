T1	Claim 1 116	Low anterior resection with coloanal anastomosis prevents a definitive stoma in patients with distal rectal cancer.
T2	Premise 117 327	However, imperative stool urge, stool fragmentation, prolonged stooling sessions, and minor problems of incontinence are frequently observed in the postoperative situation and negatively affect quality of life.
T4	Premise 1512 1633	problems with continence for liquids or gas occurred less frequently in the colonic J-pouch group 6 months after surgery.
T5	Premise 1634 1753	The frequency of bowel movements was lower in the J-pouch group (2.5 per day) than in the coloanal group (4.7 per day).
T6	Premise 1767 1935	in a manometric study at the same postoperative point, neorectal capacity was decreased to a similar degree in both groups compared with the preoperative rectal volume.
T7	Premise 1942 2043	the expected and postulated reservoir effect could not be achieved by forming a 5-cm colonic J-pouch.
T8	Claim 2044 2169	The colonic J-pouch was superior with regard to continence for gas and liquids compared with a straight coloanal anastomosis.
T9	Claim 2183 2286	stool frequency was significantly lower in the J-pouch group than in the coloanal reconstruction group.
T10	Claim 2357 2515	we speculate that the advantage of the colonic J-pouch is not in the creation of a larger neorectal reservoir but rather may be related to decreased motility.
T3	Premise 2296 2356	because neorectal capacity decreased equally in both groups,
