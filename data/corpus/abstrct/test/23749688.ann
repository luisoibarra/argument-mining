T1	Premise 760 980	Meaningful differences in aerobic fitness between the exercise and usual care groups at both the 8-week [mean 3.0 mL kg(-1) min(-1) (95 % CI -1.1-7.0)] and 3-month follow-up [2.1 mL kg(-1) min(-1) (-2.3-6.6)] were found,
T2	Premise 981 1066	although these differences did not achieve statistical significance (p values >0.14).
T3	Premise 1067 1374	Self-reported physical activity increased in the exercise group (EG) compared to the usual care group at both 8-week (p = 0.01) and 3-month follow-up (p = 0.03) and significant differences in favour of the EG were found for physical well-being at both the 8-week (p = 0.03) and 3-month follow-up (p = 0.04).
T4	Premise 1375 1553	Improvements in fatigue (p = 0.01), total quality of life plus fatigue (p = 0.04), and a composite physical functioning score (p = 0.01) at the 3-month follow-up were also found.
T5	Claim 1554 1777	The PEACH trial suggests that 8 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise training was feasible and may improve aerobic fitness, fatigue and quality of life in de-conditioned cancer survivors during the early survivorship phase.
T6	Claim 1778 1913	Exercise interventions commenced in the early survivorship phase appear safe, feasible and may lead to improvements in QOL and fatigue.
