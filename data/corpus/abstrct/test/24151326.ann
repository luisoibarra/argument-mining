T1	Premise 912 1127	Adjusted linear mixed-model analyses showed that neither HIGH (+0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.8 to 2.4; P = .30) nor COMB (+0.5; 95% CI = -1.1 to 2.1; P = .52] were superior to STAN for the primary outcome.
T2	Premise 1128 1329	In secondary analyses not adjusted for multiple comparisons, HIGH was superior to STAN for the SF-36 physical component summary (P = .04), SF-36 bodily pain (P = .02), and endocrine symptoms (P = .02).
T3	Premise 1330 1464	COMB was superior to STAN for endocrine symptoms (P = .009) and superior to STAN (P < .001) and HIGH (P < .001) for muscular strength.
T4	Premise 1465 1557	HIGH was superior to COMB for the SF-36 bodily pain (P = .04) and aerobic fitness (P = .03).
T5	Premise 1558 1629	No differences emerged for body composition or chemotherapy completion.
T6	Claim 1630 1835	A higher volume of aerobic or combined exercise is achievable and safe during breast cancer chemotherapy and may manage declines in physical functioning and worsening symptoms better than standard volumes.
