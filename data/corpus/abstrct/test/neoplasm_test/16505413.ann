T2	Claim 90 219	for patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of chemotherapy may improve outcome.
T3	Premise 511 739	Overall survival was significantly longer for HAI versus systemic treatment (median, 24.4 v 20 months; P = .0034), as were response rates (47% and 24%; P = .012) and time to hepatic progression (THP; 9.8 v 7.3 months; P = .034).
T4	Premise 740 846	Time to extrahepatic progression (7.7 v 14.8 months; P = .029) was significantly shorter in the HAI group.
T5	Premise 847 974	Quality-of-life measurements showed improved physical functioning in the HAI group at the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments.
T6	Premise 975 1179	Toxicity included grade > or = 3 neutropenia (2% and 45%; P < .01), stomatitis (0% and 24%; P < .01), and bilirubin elevation (18.6% and 0; P < .01) in the HAI and systemic treatment groups, respectively.
T7	Premise 1180 1301	A greater proportion of men versus women receiving HAI experienced biliary toxicity (37% and 15%, respectively; P = .05).
T8	Premise 1302 1449	For HAI patients with thymidylate synthase levels in tumor less than or > or = 4, the median survival was 24 and 14 months, respectively (P = .17).
T9	Claim 1450 1593	HAI therapy increased overall survival, response rate, THP, and was associated with better physical functioning compared with systemic therapy.
T10	Claim 1594 1744	Additional studies need to address the overall benefit and cost of new chemotherapy agents versus HAI alone or the combination of HAI with new agents.
