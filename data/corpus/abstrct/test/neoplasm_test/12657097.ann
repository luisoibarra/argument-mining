T1	Premise 812 912	At radical prostatectomy, pathological variables were not significantly different in the two groups.
T2	Premise 913 1004	Serum testosterone level was significantly higher (mean 359.2 compared to 10.5, P < 0.001),
T3	Premise 1005 1226	complete response rate of PSA (13% compared to 57%, P = 0.028) and rate of downsizing of prostate volume (mean, -17.7% compared to -35.4%, P = 0.038) were significantly lower in the flutamide group than in the LHRH group.
T4	Premise 1227 1441	After neoadjuvant hormone therapy, the scores on the sexual problem domain of EORTC-P (P = 0.033) and sexual desire score of SMUF (P = 0.021) were significantly higher in the flutamide group than in the LHRH group.
T5	Claim 1604 1726	This study suggests that flutamide monotherapy can be an acceptable modality as an option for neoadjuvant hormone therapy.
T6	Premise 1442 1603	At a median follow-up of 34 months after prostatectomy, biochemical failure-free survival rate in the flutamide group did not differ from that in the LHRH group.
