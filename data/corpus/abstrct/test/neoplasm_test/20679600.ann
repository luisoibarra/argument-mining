T1	Premise 995 1158	Arm symptoms were significantly more bothersome for SNAD compared with SNR patients at 6 months (mean, 4.8 v 3.0; P < .001) and at 12 months (3.6 v 2.5; P = .006).
T2	Premise 1159 1337	Longitudinally, SNAD patients were more likely to experience ipsilateral arm and breast symptoms, restricted work and social activity, and impaired QOL (P < or = .002 all items).
T3	Premise 1338 1488	From 12 to 36 months, fewer than 15% of either SNAD or SNR patients reported moderate or greater severity of any given symptom or activity limitation.
T4	Claim 1489 1539	Arm morbidity was greater with SNAD than with SNR.
T5	Claim 1614 1698	this study demonstrates that initial problems with either surgery resolve over time.
