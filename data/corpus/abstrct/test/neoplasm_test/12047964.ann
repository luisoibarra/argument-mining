T1	Premise 798 967	The hazard ratios for overall survival were 0.88 (95% CI 0.70-1.12, p=0.17) for de Gramont versus Lokich, and 0.99 (0.79-1.25, p=0.94) for de Gramont versus raltitrexed.
T2	Premise 688 797	For the de Gramont, Lokich, and raltitrexed groups, respectively, median survival was 294, 302, and 266 days.
T3	Premise 968 1138	An increase in treatment-related deaths was seen on raltitrexed (de Gramont one, Lokich two, raltitrexed 18) due to combined gastrointestinal and haematological toxicity.
T4	Premise 1139 1302	Patients' assessment of quality of life showed that raltitrexed was inferior to the fluorouracil-based regimens, especially in terms of palliation and functioning.
T5	Claim 1303 1408	The deGramont and Lokich regimens were similar in terms of survival, quality of life, and response rates.
T6	Claim 1409 1503	The Lokich regimen was associated with more central line complications and hand-foot syndrome.
T7	Claim 1504 1622	Raltitrexed showed similar response rates and overall survival to the de Gramont regimen and was easier to administer,
T8	Claim 1623 1685	but resulted in greater toxicity and inferior quality of life.
