T1	Premise 797 862	KPS was improved from baseline to post-chemotherapy in both arms.
T2	Premise 660 796	Eighteen patients experienced brief and reversible adverse events during transfusion, including two patients with acute pulmonary edema.
T3	Premise 863 914	QOL data showed improvement in some symptom scores,
T4	Premise 915 1027	but there was no difference in the QOL scores between the two arms at baseline and all four cycles of treatment.
T5	Premise 1028 1103	Similar response rates were observed in both arms (arm 1, 30%; arm 2, 35%).
T6	Premise 1104 1276	Both arms showed similar chemotherapy duration (3.8 and 4.1 months, respectively), progression-free survival (4.0 and 4.1 months) and overall survival (9.9 and 9.3 months).
T7	Claim 1277 1418	Red blood cell transfusion achieving Hb level above 10 g/dl might contribute to the improvement of the KPS and QOL seen in patients with AGC.
T8	Claim 1419 1578	The observation of equivalent outcomes at the two target Hb levels supports the feasibility of anemia correction to Hb 10 g/dl, which merits further evaluation
