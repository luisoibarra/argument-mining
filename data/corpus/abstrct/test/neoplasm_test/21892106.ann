T1	Premise 1127 1199	The overall response rate was 51% in arm A and 38% in arm B (p = 0.147).
T2	Premise 1200 1247	Grade 3/4 toxicity in both arms was acceptable.
T3	Premise 1248 1363	There was no difference in median progression-free survival between the two arms (5.5 versus 5.0 months, p = 0.19).
T4	Premise 1364 1408	Patients in arm A had longer median survival
T5	Premise 1409 1492	but this did not reach statistical significance (13.1 versus 8.3 months, p = 0.25).
T6	Claim 1493 1539	No difference in quality of life was observed.
