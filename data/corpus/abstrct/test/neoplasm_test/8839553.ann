T1	Claim 1 92	Cerebral metastasis is a common oncologic problem that occurs in 15-30% of cancer patients;
T3	Premise 772 830	No difference in survival was detected between the groups;
T4	Premise 831 1032	the median survival for the radiation group was 6.3 months (95% confidence interval, 3-11.4) compared with 5.6 months for the surgery plus radiation group (95% confidence interval, 3.9-7.2) (P = 0.24).
T5	Premise 1033 1147	Most patients died within the first year (69.8% in the radiation arm vs. 87.8% in the surgery plus radiation arm).
T6	Premise 1148 1241	There were no significant differences in the 30-day mortality, morbidity, or causes of death.
T7	Premise 1242 1327	Extracranial metastases was an important predictor of mortality (relative risk, 2.3).
T8	Premise 1328 1445	The mean proportion of days that the Karnofsky performance status was > or = 70% did not differ between the 2 groups.
T9	Claim 1446 1589	This trial failed to demonstrate that the addition of surgery to radiation therapy improved outcome of patients with a single brain metastasis.
T10	Claim 1590 1737	Thus, the efficacy of surgery plus radiation compared with radiation alone needs to be addressed by further clinical trials and/or a meta-analysis.
