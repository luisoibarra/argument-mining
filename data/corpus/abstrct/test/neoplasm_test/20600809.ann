T1	Premise 961 1181	HT patients had a minimal decrease in natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) over the course of treatment whereas NKCC of RT and UC patients declined sharply during chemoradiation (group by time interaction: p = 0.018).
T2	Premise 1182 1382	HT patients showed greater decreases in two different indicators of depressed mood (CES-D depressed mood subscale and POMS depression scale) compared to RT and UC (group by time interactions: p<0.05).
T3	Premise 1383 1482	No between group differences were observed in QOL, treatment delay, or clinically-rated toxicities.
T4	Claim 1483 1603	HT may benefit cervical cancer patients by moderating effects of chemoradiation on depressed mood and cellular immunity.
T5	Claim 1604 1685	Effects of HT on toxicities, treatment delay, QOL, and fatigue were not observed.
