T1	Claim 1 114	Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) corrects cancer-related anemia and, thereby, improves quality of life.
T2	Premise 1045 1091	No patient in G1 developed a thrombotic event.
T3	Premise 974 1044	In all four patients, Hgb levels were normal at the time of the event.
T4	Premise 1092 1206	There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics or current chemotherapy regimen in G1 vs. G2.
T5	Premise 1285 1442	The increased incidence of thrombotic events in the r-HuEPO (G2) arm of this study exceeds that in prior studies in this population and prior r-HuEPO trials.
T6	Claim 1443 1521	This may relate to the administration of r-HuEPO in this high-risk population,
T7	Claim 1522 1619	but the small sample size and possible predisposing risk factors preclude definitive conclusions.
