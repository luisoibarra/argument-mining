T1	Claim 1 82	Fatigue has a significant impact on the quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients.
T2	Claim 83 201	Recent research has suggested that physical activity can reduce fatigue in patients receiving active cancer treatment.
T3	Premise 1298 1383	Most of scores indicated less fatigue (higher score) in the standard treatment group,
T4	Premise 1384 1597	but there were no statistically significant differences found at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 27 except for SDS at week 8 (P = 0.018) with less patients reporting significant fatigue in the standard treatment arm.
T5	Premise 1598 1748	For the entire participant population, fatigue levels initially worsened with radiotherapy, stabilized at week 8, and returned to baseline by week 27.
T6	Premise 1749 1855	Disease site, chemotherapy use, and radiotherapy dose did not have a significant impact on fatigue levels.
T7	Premise 1856 1958	Radiotherapy initially caused a worsening of fatigue but with time fatigue levels returned to baseline
T8	Claim 1960 2044	Clinically, this structured multidisciplinary intervention had no impact on fatigue,
T9	Claim 2049 2165	there was the suggestion the multiple sessions may have contributed to worse fatigue during active cancer treatment.
