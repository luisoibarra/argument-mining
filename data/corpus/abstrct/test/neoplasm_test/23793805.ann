T1	Premise 878 1139	The LADG and ODG groups showed similar survival [5-year DFS rate: 98.8 % vs. 97.6 %, respectively (P = 0.514), 5-year overall survival (OS) rate: 97.6 vs. 96.3 %, respectively (P = 0.721)] or overall complication rate (29.3 vs. 42.7 %, respectively; P = 0.073).
T2	Premise 1140 1261	Mild complications were significantly less frequent in the LADG group than in the ODG group (23.2 vs. 41.5 %; P = 0.012).
T3	Premise 1262 1406	The rates of moderate, severe, and long-term complications (i.e., 31 days to 5 years after surgery) did not differ significantly between groups.
T4	Premise 1407 1498	No clinically meaningful differences were detected between the two groups in long-term QOL.
T5	Claim 1499 1579	LADG showed similar DFS and OS compared to ODG in treating early gastric cancer.
T6	Claim 1580 1644	Marginal benefits in mild complications were observed with LADG.
T7	Claim 1645 1731	LADG did not show advantages over ODG regarding other complications and long-term QOL.
