T1	Premise 1008 1140	Epoetin alfa, compared with placebo, significantly decreased transfusion requirements (P =.0057) and increased hemoglobin (P <.001).
T2	Premise 1141 1354	Improvement of all primary cancer- and anemia-specific QOL domains, including energy level, ability to do daily activities, and fatigue, was significantly (P <.01) greater for epoetin alfa versus placebo patients.
T3	Premise 1420 1524	Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a trend in overall survival favoring epoetin alfa (P =.13, log-rank test),
T4	Premise 1529 1628	Cox regression analysis showed an estimated hazards ratio of 1.309 (P =.052) favoring epoetin alfa.
T5	Premise 1629 1675	Adverse events were comparable between groups.
T6	Claim 1676 1816	Epoetin alfa safely and effectively ameliorates anemia and significantly improves QOL in cancer patients receiving nonplatinum chemotherapy.
T7	Claim 1817 1923	Encouraging results regarding increased survival warrant another trial designed to confirm these findings.
