 To evaluate whether 3-month administration of CDB-2914, a selective progesterone receptor modulator, reduces leiomyoma size and symptoms. Premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata were randomly assigned to CDB-2914 at 10 mg (T1) or 20 mg (T2) daily or to placebo (PLC) for 3 cycles or 90-102 days if no menses occurred. The primary outcome was leiomyoma volume change determined by magnetic resonance imaging at study entry and within 2 weeks of hysterectomy. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of amenorrhea, change in hemoglobin and hematocrit, ovulation inhibition, and quality-of-life assessment. Twenty-two patients were allocated, and 18 completed the trial. Age and body mass index were similar among groups. Leiomyoma volume was significantly reduced with CDB-2914 administration (PLC 6%; CDB-2914 -29%; P=.01), decreasing 36% and 21% in the T1 and T2 groups, respectively. During treatment, hemoglobin was unchanged, and the median estradiol was greater than 50 pg/mL in all groups. CDB-2914 eliminated menstrual bleeding and inhibited ovulation (% ovulatory cycles: CDB-2914, 20%; PLC, 83%; P=.001). CDB-2914 improved the concern scores of the uterine leiomyoma symptom quality-of-life subscale (P=.04). One CDB-2914 woman developed endometrial cystic hyperplasia without evidence of atypia. No serious adverse events were reported. Compared with PLC, CDB-2914 significantly reduced leiomyoma volume after three cycles, or 90-102 days. CDB-2914 treatment resulted in improvements in the concern subscale of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom Quality of Life assessment. In this small study, CDB-2914 was well-tolerated without serious adverse events. Thus, there may be a role for CDB-2914 in the treatment of leiomyomata.
