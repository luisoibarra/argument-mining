 In a prospective randomized study, 287 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage IIIb or IV with ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1 or 2 were randomly assigned to receive either best supportive care (BSC) or supportive care plus combination chemotherapy (IEP regimen: ifosfamide 3 gm/m2 IV with mesna uroprotection, epirubicin 60 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and cisplatin 60 mg/m2 IV on day 2; or MVP regimen: mitomycin-C 8 mg/m2, cisplatin 100 mg/m2 IV on day 1, vinblastine 4 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 15). Serial assessment of Karnofsky performance status (KPS), modified Functional Living Index-Cancer (T-FLIC) and modified Quality of Life-Index (T-QLI) were used to estimate the quality of life. Interviews were done at entry, at the third month and at 2 months post complete treatment. At least two courses of chemotherapy were considered to be adequate for response evaluation. Patients were treated for a total of four to six courses or until progression of disease. Partial response rates were 40 and 41.7% in IEP and MVP arms. Median survival durations were 5.9 and 8.1 months for the IEP and MVP chemotherapy arms, and 4.1 months for BSC (log-rank test: P = 0.0003). One year survival was 13, 29.8 and 39.3% for the BSC, IEP and MVP regimens, respectively. Two years survival was 7.8, 6.4 and 13.1% for the BSC, IEP and MVP regimens, respectively. Improvement in quality of life (QOL) scores at the first, second and third interview were seen in chemotherapy arms only, not in the BSC arm. We conclude that combination chemotherapy improves the quality of life as well as prolonging the survival of patients with advanced NSCLC.
