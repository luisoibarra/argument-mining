T1	Premise 663 970	Hematologic toxicity was significantly more severe in arm A (leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia grade 3 or 4: 66% v 19%, 83% v 55%, 36% v 2% in arms A and B, respectively), which resulted in more febrile neutropenia (27% v 3% in arms A and B, respectively), dose reductions, and treatment delays.
T2	Premise 971 1074	There were a total of nine toxic deaths, six due to neutropenic sepsis: five in arm A and one in arm B.
T3	Premise 1075 1279	In contrast, arthralgia/myalgia (grade 2 or 3, 4% v 17%), peripheral neurotoxicity (grade 2 or 3, 6% v 29%), and hypersensitivity reactions (1% v 7%, all grades) were significantly more frequent in arm B.
T4	Claim 1280 1364	The frequency and severity of other toxicities were comparable between the two arms.
T5	Premise 1365 1481	Responses were one complete and 44 partial on arm A (28%) and two complete and 61 partial (41%) on arm B (P = .018).
T6	Premise 1482 1634	There was no significant difference in survival, with median and 1-year survivals 9.9 versus 9.7 months and 41% versus 43%, respectively in arm A and B.
T7	Premise 1635 1713	Progression-free survival was 4.9 and 5.4 months in arm A and B, respectively.
T8	Premise 1950 2116	Arm B achieved a better score at week 6 for emotional, cognitive and social functioning, global health status, fatigue, and appetite loss, which was lost at 12 weeks.
T9	Claim 2117 2216	In conclusion, arm B appears superior to arm A with regard to response rate, side effects, and QoL.
T10	Claim 2217 2252	Although survival was not improved,
T11	Claim 2253 2325	arm B offers a better palliation for advanced NSCLC patients than arm A.
