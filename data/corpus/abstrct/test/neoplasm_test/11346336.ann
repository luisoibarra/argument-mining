T1	Premise 1287 1583	Responses (> or = 50% improvement) were seen in 3 (20%) of 15 patients with an initial dose at 6.5 mg/m(2) per day (95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-40%), 15 (54%) of 28 patients at 300 mg/m(2) per day (95% CI, 35%-72%), and 10 (67%) of 15 patients at above 300 mg/m(2) per day (95% CI, 43%-91%).
T2	Premise 1584 1676	The rate of progressive disease was 47%, 21%, and 13% at the same dose levels, respectively.
T3	Premise 1677 1782	Eight (73%) of 11 patients crossing over from 6.5 mg/m(2) per day to higher doses subsequently responded.
T4	Premise 1783 1983	The median duration of response from start of therapy could not be estimated for the 15 patients at 300 mg/m(2) per day owing to low relapse rates in 2 patients (13%); at higher doses it was 516 days.
T5	Premise 1984 2281	The following drug-related adverse effects were reversible and treatable: hypertriglyceridemia (46 patients [79%]), hypercholesterolemia (28 patients [48%]), headache (27 patients [47%]), central hypothyroidism (23 patients [40%]), asthenia (21 patients [36%]), and leukopenia (16 patients [28%]).
T6	Premise 2282 2352	No cases of drug-related neutropenic fever, sepsis, or death occurred.
T7	Premise 2353 2524	Pancreatitis occurred in 3 patients with triglyceride levels higher than 14.69 mmol/L (1300 mg/dL), all of whom were taking 300 mg/m(2) or more of oral bexarotene per day.
T8	Claim 2525 2790	Bexarotene (Targretin capsules) (the first retinoid X receptor-selective rexinoid) was well tolerated and effective as an oral treatment for 15 (54%) of 28 patients with refractory or persistent early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma at doses of 300 mg/m(2) per day.
T9	Claim 2791 2912	Hypertriglyceridemia and hypothyroidism require monitoring but are reversible and manageable with concomitant medication.
