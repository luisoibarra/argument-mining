T1	Premise 881 968	Grades 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity and fatigue occurred more frequently in the TCG arm.
T2	Claim 982 1064	quality-of-life analysis during chemotherapy showed a disadvantage in the TCG arm.
T3	Premise 1065 1128	Although objective response was slightly higher in the TCG arm,
T4	Premise 1129 1223	this did not translate into improved progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS).
T5	Premise 1224 1357	Median PFS was 17.8 months for the TCG arm and 19.3 months for the TC arm (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.32; P = .0044).
T6	Premise 1358 1468	Median OS was 49.5 for the TCG arm and 51.5 months for the TC arm (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.20; P = .5106).
T7	Claim 1469 1649	The addition of gemcitabine to carboplatin plus paclitaxel increased treatment burden, reduced PFS time, and did not improve OS in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.
T8	MajorClaim 1650 1727	Therefore, we recommend no additional clinical use of TCG in this population.
