T1	Claim 1 104	Advice to rest and take things easy if patients become fatigued during radiotherapy may be detrimental.
T2	Premise 105 213	Aerobic walking improves physical functioning and has been an intervention for chemotherapy-related fatigue.
T3	Premise 752 907	There were no significant between group differences noted with regard to fatigue scores at baseline (P = 0.55) or after 4 weeks of radiotherapy (P = 0.18).
T4	Premise 908 1104	Men in the control group had significant increases in fatigue scores from baseline to the end of radiotherapy (P = 0.013), with no significant increases observed in the exercise group (P = 0.203).
T6	Premise 1105 1331	A nonsignificant reduction (2.4%) in shuttle test distance at the end of radiotherapy was observed in the control group; however, in the exercise group, there was a significant increase (13.2%) in distance walked (P = 0.0003).
T8	Premise 1332 1534	Men who followed advice to rest and take things easy if they became fatigued demonstrated a slight deterioration in physical functioning and a significant increase in fatigue at the end of radiotherapy.
T9	Claim 1535 1673	Home-based, moderate-intensity walking produced a significant improvement in physical functioning with no significant increase in fatigue.
T10	Claim 1674 1749	Improved physical functioning may be necessary to combat radiation fatigue.
