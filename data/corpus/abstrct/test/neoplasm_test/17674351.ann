T1	Claim 1 108	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a putative mediator of the cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome.
T2	Premise 762 884	Over time, weight gain was found to be minimal in both treatment arms; no patient gained >or=10% of their baseline weight.
T3	Premise 885 986	Previously validated appetite questionnaires revealed negligible improvements in both treatment arms.
T4	Premise 987 1124	The median survival was also comparable (175 days vs 148 days in etanercept-treated and placebo-exposed patients, respectively; P = .82).
T5	Premise 1134 1344	preliminary data regarding adverse events demonstrated that patients treated with etanercept had higher rates of neurotoxicity (29% vs 0%) but lower rates of anemia (0% vs 19%) and thrombocytopenia (0% vs 14%).
T6	Premise 1345 1392	Infection rates were negligible in both groups.
T7	Premise 1393 1627	Genotyping for TNF-alpha-238 and TNF-alpha-308 polymorphisms revealed no clinical significance for these genotypes, except for a preliminary association between presence of the -238 G/A genotype and relatively less favorable survival.
T8	Claim 1628 1779	Etanercept, as prescribed in the current trial, does not appear to palliate the cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome in patients with advanced disease.
