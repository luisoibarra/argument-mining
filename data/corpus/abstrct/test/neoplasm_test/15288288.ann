T2	Premise 862 941	Dysphagia improved more rapidly after stent placement than after brachytherapy,
T3	Premise 942 1007	but long-term relief of dysphagia was better after brachytherapy.
T4	Premise 1008 1208	For generic HRQoL, there was an overall significant difference in favour of brachytherapy on four out of five functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (role, emotional, cognitive and social) (P < 0.05).
T5	Premise 1209 1425	Generic HRQoL deteriorated over time on all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and EQ-5D, in particular physical and role functioning (on average -23 and -24 on a 100 points scale during 0.5 years of follow-up).
T6	Premise 1426 1478	This decline was more pronounced in the stent group.
T7	Premise 1479 1672	Major improvements were seen on the dysphagia and eating scales of the EORTC OES-23, in contrast to other scales of this disease-specific measure, which remained almost stable during follow-up.
T9	Premise 1673 1774	Reported levels of chest or abdominal pain remained stable during follow-up in both treatment groups,
T10	Premise 1775 1823	general pain levels increased to a minor extent.
T11	Claim 1824 1963	The effects of single dose brachytherapy on HRQoL compared favourably to those of stent placement for the palliation of oesophageal cancer.
T12	Claim 1964 2066	Future studies on palliative care for oesophageal cancer should at least include generic HRQoL scales,
T13	Premise 2067 2202	since these were more responsive in measuring patients' functioning and well-being during follow-up than disease-specific HRQoL scales.
