T1	Premise 1033 1153	Only the dyspnea symptom scale showed superior results for R-Y than for B-I (B-I 13.6 ± 17.9, R-Y 8.6 ± 16.3, p = 0.02).
T2	Premise 1154 1282	With respect to DAUGS 20, the total score did not differ significantly between the R-Y and B-I groups (24.8 vs. 23.6, p = 0.41).
T3	Premise 1283 1386	Only reflux symptoms were significantly worse for B-I than for R-Y (0.7 ± 0.6 vs. 0.5 ± 0.6, p = 0.01).
T4	Claim 1387 1486	The B-I and R-Y techniques were generally equivalent in terms of postoperative QOL and dysfunction.
T5	MajorClaim 1487 1621	Both procedures seem acceptable as standard reconstructions after distal gastrectomy with regard to postoperative QOL and dysfunction.
