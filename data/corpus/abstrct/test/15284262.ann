T1	Premise 938 1105	Objective responses occurred in 19% (6% complete plus 13% partial) of patients receiving cisplatin versus 36% (15% complete plus 21% partial) receiving C+P (P = .002).
T2	Premise 1106 1195	The median PFS was 2.8 and 4.8 months, respectively, for cisplatin versus C+P (P < .001).
T3	Premise 1196 1265	There was no difference in median survival (8.8 months v 9.7 months).
T4	Premise 1266 1342	Grade 3 to 4 anemia and neutropenia were more common in the combination arm.
T5	Premise 1343 1393	There was no significant difference in QOL scores,
T6	Premise 1394 1594	although a disproportionate number of patients (cisplatin, n = 50; C+P, n = 33) dropped out of the QOL component, presumably because of increasing disease, deteriorating health status, or early death.
T7	Claim 1595 1687	C+P is superior to cisplatin alone with respect to response rate and PFS with sustained QOL.
