T1	Premise 683 812	Percentage of IOP reduction or the magnitude of IOP reduction showed no intergroup differences either at any time point (13-15%).
T2	Premise 813 982	In the visual field, the estimated rate of change in the MD value (dB/year) was -0.34+/-0.17 (SE) for the latanoprost group, and -0.10+/-0.18 (SE) for the timolol group.
T3	Premise 983 1130	The estimated rate of change in MD showed no significant difference from zero in both groups, and there were no statistical intergroup differences.
T4	Premise 1131 1292	No changes in the optic nerve head topography in the vertical cup-to-disc ratio and rim area measured by image-analysis techniques were observed in either group.
T5	Premise 1293 1378	There were no patients who dropped out due to the side effects of treatment regimens.
T6	Claim 1379 1508	Both latanoprost and timolol single treatments reduced IOP by 13-15% at their trough effects for 3 years in Japanese NTG patients
T7	Claim 1510 1566	both showed similar effects on visual field performance.
