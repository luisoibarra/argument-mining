T1	Claim 1901 2013	Mitomycin C did not increase the short- or intermediate-term success rates of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve implantation.
T2	Premise 981 1225	After a mean follow-up of 12.3 months, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a probability of success of 59% at 18 months for the MMC group and 61% for the control group when the first criterion for success was used (IOP between 6 and 21 mmHg).
T3	Premise 1226 1450	When an IOP reduction of at least 30% was used as the criterion to define success, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a probability of success at 18 months of 62% for the MMC group and 67% for the control group.
T4	Premise 1451 1588	There were no significant differences in survival rates between the 2 groups with either criterion (P = 0.75 and P = 0.37, respectively).
T5	Premise 1589 1692	After 15 days postoperatively, the mean IOP did not significantly differ for both MMC and control eyes.
T6	Premise 1693 1794	Mean numbers of postoperative antiglaucoma medications were similar in MMC-treated eyes and controls.
T7	Premise 1795 1900	There was no significant difference between the incidences of postoperative complications in both groups.
