T1	Claim 1925 2016	The dorzolamide/timolol combination and latanoprost were equally effective at lowering IOP.
T2	Premise 954 1221	At baseline, the mean daytime diurnal IOP was 26.1 mmHg in the dorzolamide/timolol combination group versus 25.6 mmHg in the latanoprost group in Study 1, and 25.3 mmHg in the dorzolamide/timolol combination group versus 24.7 mmHg in the latanoprost group in Study 2.
T3	Premise 1222 1459	After 3 months, the mean daytime diurnal IOP was 18.9 mmHg for the dorzolamide/timolol combination versus 18.4 mmHg for latanoprost in Study 1, and 17.4 mmHg for the dorzolamide/timolol combination versus 17.5 for latanoprost in Study 2.
T4	Premise 1460 1642	The difference between treatments in mean IOP change at 3 months was -0.04 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.85, 0.77] in Study 1, and -0.57 mmHg (95% CI -1.31, 0.16) in Study 2.
T5	Claim 1782 1832	Both treatments were well tolerated over 3 months,
T6	Premise 1643 1781	The probability that the true difference lay between -1.5 and 1.5 mmHg, the predefined bounds for equivalence, was >0.950 in both studies.
T7	Premise 1833 1924	although ocular stinging occurred more frequently with the dorzolamide/timolol combination.
