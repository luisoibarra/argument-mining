To evaluate the long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) control of trabeculectomy and triple procedure (cataract extraction by phacoemulsification, intraocular lens implantation and trabeculectomy), 1,542 eyes of 900 patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or chronic primary angle closure glaucoma (CPACG) were included. When success was defined as an IOP reduction of at least 30% from baseline, with or without antiglaucoma medications, the overall probability of success of trabeculectomy and triple procedure was 0.613 and 0.733 at 15 years, respectively. The success probability of trabeculectomy and triple procedure in reducing IOP below 18 mm Hg was 0.748 and 0.825 at 15 years, respectively. In POAG and CPACG patients, trabeculectomy and triple procedure were effective in reducing IOP for up to 15 years after surgery.
