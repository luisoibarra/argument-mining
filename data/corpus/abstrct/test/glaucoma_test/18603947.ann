T1	Premise 731 889	Significantly higher number of eyes belonging to group A (14 eyes) had shallower anterior chamber than group B (7 eyes) on first post operative day (p=0.042).
T2	Premise 890 1027	Six eyes (30%) in group A had peripheral or central irido-corneal touch in early postoperative period as compared to only one in Group B.
T3	Claim 1199 1262	Both the groups had a significant drop in IOP following surgery
T4	Premise 1273 1429	there was no significant difference in the IOP between the two groups after 6 weeks (Group A: 10.95 +/- 3.03 mmHg vs. Group B: 12.29 +/- 4.67 mmHg; p=0.87).
T5	Premise 1430 1558	There was a significant drop in IOP following removal of sutures (15.19 +/- 6.15 mmHg to 13.19 +/- 6.13 mmHg; p=006) in group B.
T6	Claim 1559 1761	Use of combination of permanent and releasable scleral flap sutures is a safe technique that significantly reduces the incidence of immediate postoperative shallow anterior chamber after trabeculectomy.
