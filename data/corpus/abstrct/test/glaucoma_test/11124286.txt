To report a randomized clinical trial of postoperative subconjunctival injections of low-dose 5-fluorouracil in patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy.
In a prospective, randomized clinical trial, 40 eyes of 40 patients were randomized to the low-dose 5-fluorouracil group and received three subconjunctival injections of 5 mg each over 11 postoperative days, and 40 eyes of 40 patients were randomized to trabeculectomy without 5-fluorouracil.
Mean (+/-SD) preoperative and 1-year postoperative intraocular pressures in the 5-fluorouracil group were 26.9 (+/-9.5) and 15.3 (+/-5.8) mm Hg, respectively. In the control group these were 25.9 (+/-8.1) mm Hg, and 15.8 (+/-5.1) mm Hg, respectively. The patients who received 5-fluorouracil had a mean reduction in intraocular pressure of 11.5 (+/-9.1) mm Hg at a median follow-up of 52.3 weeks. The control group had a mean reduction in intraocular pressure of 10.2 (+/-8.7) mm Hg at a median follow-up of 52.6 weeks. These differences were not statistically significant.
Three postoperative subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil injections of 5 mg each after trabeculectomy in eyes at low risk for failure had no statistically or clinically significant effect on reduction of intraocular pressure with 1-year follow-up. Enhancement of success in this group of patients may require a larger total dose of 5-fluorouracil.
