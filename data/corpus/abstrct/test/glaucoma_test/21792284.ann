T1	Claim 1911 2010	Both fixed brimonidine-timolol and timolol were well tolerated as agents adjunctive to latanoprost.
T2	Claim 1719 1910	Fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol reduced IOP significantly more effectively than timolol when used as adjunctive therapy to latanoprost in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension.
T3	Premise 1625 1718	Biomicroscopy findings were similar between the treatment groups after 12 weeks of treatment.
T4	Premise 1523 1624	Adverse events occurred in 14.7% of fixed brimonidine-timolol patients and 12.7% of timolol patients.
T5	Premise 1244 1522	Patients treated with fixed brimonidine-timolol adjunctive to latanoprost were significantly more likely than patients treated with adjunctive timolol to achieve an IOP <18 mmHg (P = 0.028) and a  20% reduction in IOP from baseline (P = 0.047) at both 8 am and 10 am in week 12.
T6	Premise 1059 1243	The mean additional reduction from latanoprost-treated baseline IOP was 8.3 mmHg (35.5%) with fixed brimonidine-timolol and 6.2 mmHg (27.0%) with timolol at 10 am, week 12 (P < 0.001).
