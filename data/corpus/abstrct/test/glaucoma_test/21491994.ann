T1	Premise 685 818	There was no significant difference between the 2 study groups regarding the baseline characteristics and the baseline IOP (P=0.628).
T2	Premise 819 1045	Patients who received placebo as premedication had significantly higher IOP at 6 (17.96±5.49 vs 13.61±4.09; P<0.001) and 12 (16.90±4.11 vs 13.96±3.25; P=0.003) h postoperatively compared with those who received oral clonidine.
T3	Premise 1055 1190	there was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the IOP at 24h after operation (15.41±3.96 vs 16.01±3.41; P=0.0539).
T4	Premise 1191 1332	The prevalence of acute IOP rise (>21 mmHg) was significantly higher in placebo group compared with clonidine group (25.8% vs 9.6%; P=0.091).
T5	Claim 1333 1552	Administering preoperative oral clonidine in a dosage of 5g/kg, 2h before phacoemulsification, significantly decreases the prevalence and intensity of acute postoperative IOP rise in those undergoing general anesthesia.
T6	Claim 1553 1719	Oral clonidine is safe, cheap, and easily accessible and, thus, it is recommended for controlling the IOP after phacoemulsification, especially in high-risk patients.
