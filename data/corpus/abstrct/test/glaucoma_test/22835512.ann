T1	Claim 1963 2125	The current results and large number of drop-outs in the brimonidine 0.2% arm suggest that more research is necessary before altering clinical practice paradigms.
T2	Claim 1782 1962	This suggests that the beneficial effect of randomization to the brimonidine arm was independent of possible differences in ocular perfusion pressures between the 2 treatment arms.
T3	Premise 922 1071	Eyes randomized to timolol progressed faster than those randomized to brimonidine (mean rates of progression, -0.38  0.9 vs 0.02  0.7 dB/y, P < .01).
T4	Premise 1460 1563	randomization to brimonidine revealed a protective effect (HR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.55, P < .001).
T6	Premise 1570 1644	randomization to brimonidine 0.2% was protective compared to timolol 0.5%,
T7	Premise 1646 1781	ower mean ocular perfusion pressure increased the risk for reaching a progression outcome in the Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study.
T5	Premise 1141 1451	older age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.41/decade older, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05 to 1.90, P = .022), use of systemic antihypertensives (HR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.32 to 4.87, P = .005), and mean ocular perfusion pressure (HR = 1.21/mm Hg lower, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.31, P < .001) were associated with progression
