T1	Premise 795 967	At the end of the 24-month follow-up, IOP of 21 mmHg or less and more than 6 mmHg was achieved in 76% in group 1 (n = 19) and in 80% in group 2 (n = 20; log-rank P = 0.60);
T2	Premise 968 1135	an IOP between 6 and 16 mmHg was obtained in 56% in group 1 (n = 14) and in 72% in group 2 (n = 18; log-rank P = 0.17; Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability of success).
T3	Premise 1136 1480	Complications of viscocanalostomy included one intraoperative conversion into trabeculectomy; microruptures in Descemet's membrane in five eyes; three cases of iris incarceration in the Decemet's window, two of which caused early failure of the procedure requiring reoperation; and a 1-mm to 2-mm transient self-resolving hyphema in three cases
T4	Premise 1482 1811	Complications of trabeculectomy included one case of postoperative bleb bleeding with early transient IOP spike; one early hyphema; five cases of postoperative hypotony, two of which had a positive Seidel test from the conjunctival suture; three cases of transient choroidal detachment, two of which had shallow anterior chamber.
T5	Premise 1812 1844	No patient required reoperation.
T6	Premise 1845 1985	Two eyes required argon laser suture lysis, and nine underwent one or more 5-FU injections, which caused punctate keratopathy in three eyes.
T7	Claim 1986 2090	Viscocanalostomy is an effective IOP-lowering procedure in white adults affected by open-angle glaucoma.
T8	Claim 2091 2266	Trabeculectomy with postoperative 5-FU can probably provides lower IOPs but, with more numerous complications, greater discomfort, and more intensive postoperative management.
