To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) reducing effect and safety of latanoprost 0.005% once daily with unoprostone 0.12% twice daily in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OH).
An 8-week, double-masked, randomized, parallel-group, single-center clinical trial.
A total of 108 patients with POAG or OH were enrolled.
After completing a wash-out of ocular hypotensive medications, patients were randomized to receive either latanoprost once daily in the evening plus placebo once daily in the morning, or unoprostone twice daily (morning and evening).
IOP was measured at 10:00 AM and at 5:00 PM at baseline and at week 8, and before 12:00 noon at week 2. Ocular and systemic safety assessments were performed.
From an overall baseline of 24.1 mmHg, latanoprost reduced IOP by 6.7 mmHg (28%) and unoprostone reduced IOP by 3.3 mmHg (14%). The difference between the groups of 3.4 mmHg was significant (P: < 0.001, analysis of covariance; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.7 to -2.1) in favor of latanoprost. A >/=30% reduction in mean IOP from baseline was achieved by 44% of latanoprost-treated patients compared with 8% of unoprostone-treated patients. The incidence of adverse events was low and comparable between the groups.
Latanoprost administered once daily was significantly more effective in reducing IOP compared with unoprostone administered twice daily in patients with POAG and OH.
