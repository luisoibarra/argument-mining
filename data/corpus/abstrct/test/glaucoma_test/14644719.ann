T1	Claim 1682 1865	In individuals with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled on a topical beta-blocker alone, bimatoprost lowered IOP more consistently than did combined timolol and dorzolamide.
T2	Premise 839 942	Bimatoprost provided significantly greater IOP lowering compared with combined timolol and dorzolamide.
T3	Premise 943 1132	At the 8 AM measurements, bimatoprost lowered mean IOP 6.8 mmHg to 7.6 mmHg from baseline, whereas combined timolol and dorzolamide lowered mean IOP 4.4 to 5.0 mmHg from baseline (P<0.001).
T5	Premise 1133 1251	At the last follow-up, patients had better diurnal IOP control with bimatoprost than combined timolol and dorzolamide.
T6	Premise 1252 1495	At 8 AM at the 3-month visit, the percentages of patients achieving IOPs of <or =13 mmHg, < or =14 mmHg, < or =15 mmHg, or < or =16 mmHg were more than twice as high for bimatoprost than for combined timolol and dorzolamide (all P< or =0.008).
T7	Premise 1496 1681	Taste perversion, ocular burning, and stinging with instillation were more common with combined timolol and dorzolamide, whereas conjunctival hyperemia was more common with bimatoprost.
