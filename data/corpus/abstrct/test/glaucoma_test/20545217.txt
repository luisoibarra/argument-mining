To compare the efficacy and safety of 0.0015% tafluprost ophthalmic solution (Tafluprost) with Placebo ophthalmic solution (Placebo) in normal tension glaucoma (NTG).
Total of 94 patients enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group and multicenter study.
Patients with NTG were randomly assigned to either Tafluprost or Placebo. Both ophthalmic solutions were instilled once a day in the morning for 4 weeks.
Mean intraocular pressure (IOP) changes from baseline were -4.0 +/- 1.7 mmHg in Tafluprost administered patients and -1.4 +/- 1.8 mmHg in Placebo administered patients at 4 weeks, with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001). IOP change at 4 weeks, % IOP reduction at 2 and 4 weeks were also significantly greater in Tafluprost than in Placebo. A total of 51.0% in Tafluprost treated group and 8.9% in Placebo treated group reported adverse drug reactions.
These results indicate that Tafluprost is clinically useful in the treatment of NTG.
