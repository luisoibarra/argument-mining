T1	Premise 905 1090	eyes in the SLT and the travoprost groups achieved a significant reduction in IOP compared with the baseline IOP values (-3.7 mm Hg [P = 0.002] vs -4.1 mm Hg [P < 0.001], respectively).
T2	Premise 1395 1525	Ninety-six percent of NTG eyes in the travoprost group, and 82% of eyes in the SLT group had IOP fluctuations <3 mm Hg (P = 0.01).
T3	Premise 1526 1635	Success in fluctuation reduction was 75% and 92% for the SLT and travoprost groups, respectively (P = 0.005).
T4	Claim 1768 1827	the SLT's effect was significant only during the nighttime.
T5	Claim 1636 1761	The effect of travoprost on IOP reduction in POAG and NTG patients was significant both during the daytime and the nighttime,
T6	Claim 1828 1915	Both travoprost and SLT can significantly reduce the IOP in patients with POAG and NTG.
T7	Claim 1945 2029	travoprost better controls IOP fluctuations than SLT, especially during the daytime.
