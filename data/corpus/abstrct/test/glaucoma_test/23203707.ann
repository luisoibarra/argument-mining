T1	Claim 1253 1343	Preservative-free latanoprost has the same efficacy as BPL, with improved local tolerance.
T2	Premise 1085 1252	Upon instillation, the global subjective ocular symptom score was significantly lower on T2345 than BPL on D42 (0.15 vs 0.41; p=0.001) and D84 (0.18 vs 0.46; p=0.001).
T3	Premise 936 1084	Moderate to severe conjunctival hyperaemia was less frequent on T2345 than on BPL at D42 (20.2% vs 30.6%; p=0.003) and D84 (21.4% vs 29.1%; p=0.02).
T4	Premise 803 935	The most frequent ocular adverse event, drug intolerance, was reported in 1 (0.5%) patient on T2345 versus 4 (2.1%) patients on BPL.
T6	Premise 612 754	Mean IOP reduction (D0-D84) was -8.6 ±2.6 mm Hg (-36%) on T2345 and -9.0 ±2.4 mm Hg (-38%) on BPL, confirming non-inferiority of T2345 to BPL.
