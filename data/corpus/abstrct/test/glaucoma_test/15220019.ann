T1	Claim 2408 2488	Latanoprost was better tolerated than fixed-combination dorzolamide and timolol.
T2	Premise 1493 1668	Mean (SD) diurnal IOP reductions at week 8 before the water-drinking test were 6.9 (3.0) mm Hg for the latanoprost group and 6.4 (3.2) mm Hg for the dorzolamide/timolol group.
T3	Premise 1425 1492	Mean baseline diurnal IOP values were similar between the 2 groups.
T4	Premise 1669 1817	Mean IOP values were similar at all time points except at 5:00 pm, when levels were significantly lower in latanoprost-treated patients (P = 0.025).
T5	Premise 1818 2012	After the water-drinking test, the increase in IOP values was similar between groups at baseline but lower in latanoprost-treated patients at week 8 (adjusted difference, 1.08 mm Hg; P = 0.012).
T6	Premise 2013 2125	Fewer patients treated with latanoprost reported ocular or systemic AEs (P = 0.025 and P < 0.001, respectively).
T7	Claim 2126 2307	In this study of patients with unilateral or bilateral primary open-angle, pigmentary, or exfoliative glaucoma or OHT IOP reductions generally were similar between treatment groups,
T8	Claim 2308 2407	except at 5:00 pm, when the mean IOP level was significantly lower in latanoprost-treated patients.
