T1	Premise 773 937	At 1 year after surgery, the mean IOP was 15.6+/-2.4mm Hg in the ologen group (P<0.01, 43% reduction) and 11.5+/-4.1 mm Hg in the MMC group (P<0.01, 50% reduction).
T2	Claim 1470 1558	However, the bleb morphology caused more problems in the MMC group (avascularity score).
T3	Claim 1343 1469	The complete success rate using trabeculectomy with the ologen implant is lower than that achieved by trabeculectomy with MMC.
T4	Premise 938 1102	No anti-glaucomatous medication was necessary in the MMC group in the first year of follow-up, whereas five patients in the ologen group required topical treatment.
T6	Premise 1103 1192	The absolute success rate was 100% in the MMC group and 50% in the ologen group (P=0.01).
T7	Premise 1193 1342	After 1 year, filtering blebs developed significantly more avascular areas in the MMC group (score=1.4) than in the ologen group (score=2.8; P<0.01).
