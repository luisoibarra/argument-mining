T1	Premise 1235 1467	Cumulative successes in the Ahmed group were 0.73 at 1 year and 0.62 at 2 years, whereas cumulative successes in the Baerveldt group were 0.92 at 1 year and 0.85 at 2 years (Kaplan-Meier survival functions: P = 0.03, log rank test).
T2	Claim 1468 1594	Male gender, African descent, neovascular glaucoma, and Ahmed implantation were found to be significant predictors of failure.
T3	Premise 1595 1867	At last follow-up visit, eyes in the Ahmed group had a significantly higher mean IOP (19.8+/-9.5 vs. 15.8+/-7.9 mmHg, P = 0.003, t test) and more antiglaucoma medications (1.4+/-1.2 vs. 0.9+/-1.1 medications, P = 0.008, Mann-Whitney test) than eyes in the Baerveldt group.
T4	Claim 1963 2099	Our study suggests that the Ahmed S2 Glaucoma Valve may be less effective at lowering IOP than the Baerveldt 250-mm(2) Glaucoma Implant.
