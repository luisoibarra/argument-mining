T1	Claim 2039 2138	Both latanoprost and timolol had favorable safety profiles over the duration of this 3-month trial.
T2	Premise 1292 1448	Mean IOP reductions for latanoprost and timolol at week 12 were 7.2 and 5.7 mmHg, respectively, with a difference of 1.5 mmHg (95% CI, -0.8 to 3.7; P=0.21).
T3	Premise 1449 1519	Responder rates were 60% for latanoprost and 52% for timolol (P=0.33).
T4	Premise 1520 1687	Between-treatment differences in mean IOP reduction for PCG and non-PCG subgroups were 0.6 mmHg (95% CI, -2.3 to 3.4) and 2.6 mmHg (95% CI, -0.8 to 6.1), respectively.
T5	Premise 1688 1814	Responder rates for latanoprost versus timolol were 50% versus 46% for the PCG group and 72% versus 57% for the non-PCG group.
T6	Claim 1851 2038	Latanoprost 0.005% is not inferior (i.e., is either more or similarly effective) to timolol and produces clinically relevant IOP reductions across pediatric patients with and without PCG.
T7	Claim 1815 1850	Both therapies were well tolerated.
