T2	Premise 1153 1389	Diurnal IOP reductions of 30% or more from baseline to week 12 were achieved by 73.5%, 57.5%, and 32.8% of those treated with FCLT, latanoprost, and timolol, respectively (P = .007 for FCLT vs timolol; P < .001 for FCLT vs latanoprost).
T3	Premise 1007 1152	FCLT was associated with greater percentage reductions in diurnal IOP levels and a greater likelihood of achieving lower mean diurnal IOP levels.
T4	Premise 872 993	FCLT was statistically superior to latanoprost at 7 of 9 time points and at all 9 time points when compared with timolol.
T5	Claim 1425 1611	Fixed-combination latanoprost-timolol therapy is as safe and effective in lowering IOP in patients with either ocular hypertension or glaucoma as monotherapy with latanoprost or timolol.
T6	MajorClaim 1612 1725	Combination therapy can be used to treat patients for whom monotherapy does not provide sufficient IOP reduction.
T7	MajorClaim 1726 1824	The simplicity, efficacy, and tolerability of FCLT contribute to its utility in clinical practice.
T1	Claim 1390 1424	All therapies were well tolerated.
