T1	Premise 899 1036	The mean baseline intraocular pressure was 23.8 +/- 12.6 mmHg in the study group and 25.9 +/- 10.6 mmHg in the control group (P = 0.513).
T2	Premise 1194 1394	There was no statistically significant difference in the mean values of Schirmer's tear test 1 and the level of conjunctival hyperaemia between the two groups at baseline, months 1 and 6 post surgery.
T3	Premise 1395 1605	The treatment group had a statistically significant decrease in ocular surface disease index score at 6 months (P = 0.003), indicating less severity of dry eye symptoms and significant reduction in ocular pain.
T4	Claim 1606 1795	Topical cyclosporine 0.05% had no effect on postoperative bleb function and intraocular pressure following trabeculectomy, but improved subjective ocular surface symptoms in these patients.

T5	Premise 1037 1193	Mean intraocular pressure at postoperative month 6 was 14.88 +/- 6.2 and 14.62 +/- 5.46 mmHg in the study group and control group, respectively (P = 0.837).
