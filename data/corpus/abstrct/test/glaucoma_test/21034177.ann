T2	Claim 653 763	Bimatoprost provided greater (nonsignificant) mean IOP reductions from baseline than travoprost at each visit.
T3	Premise 764 972	Mean IOP reduction was 8.77 mm Hg (33.39%) and 8.42 mm Hg (31.54%) at 2 weeks (P = 0.703), and 8.47 mm Hg (31.61%) and 7.84 mm Hg (29.50%) at 6 months (P = 0.536) for bimatoprost and travoprost, respectively.
T4	Premise 973 1283	IOPs at 2 weeks were 18 mm Hg in 20 (58.8%) versus 19 (50%) eyes (P = 0.603), and 16 mm Hg in 12 (35%) versus 12 (32%) eyes (P = 0.456); and at 6 months 18 mm Hg in 22 (65%) versus 14 (37%) eyes (P = 0.045), and 16 mm Hg in 12 (35%) versus 7 (18%) eyes (P = 0.037) for bimatoprost and travoprost, respectively.
T5	Claim 1284 1353	Ocular adverse and clinical success occurred equally with both drops.
T6	Claim 1354 1388	Both drops lowered IOP effectively
T7	Claim 1389 1475	but bimatoprost showed a greater non-significant reductions in mean IOP from baseline.
T1	Premise 553 652	Both drops provided statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline at all visits (P<0.001).
