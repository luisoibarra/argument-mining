T1	Claim 2055 2278	Travoprost produced clinically relevant and statistically significant additional intraocular pressure reductions from baseline when used adjunctively with timolol in subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
T2	Premise 886 1047	Mean baseline values (25 mm Hg) for subjects at eligibility (while maintained on timolol) were not significantly different (P <.0001) among the treatment groups.
T3	Premise 1048 1207	The intraocular pressure was lowered an additional -5.7 to -7.2 mm Hg and -5.1 to -6.7 mm Hg in the travoprost 0.004% and 0.0015% concentrations, respectively.
T4	Premise 1208 1311	These changes were significantly (P < or =.0001) different from the vehicle group (-1.3 to -2.8 mm Hg).
T5	Premise 1312 1553	The intraocular pressure range on treatment at all visit times over the 6-month treatment period ranged from 17.9 to 19.2 mm Hg for travoprost 0.004% and 18.3 to 20.1 mm Hg for travoprost 0.0015% compared with 22.4 to 24.1 mm Hg for vehicle.
T6	Premise 1554 1705	Average hyperemia scores ranged from trace to mild (mean 0.5 on a scale of 0 = none/trace; 1= mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe) for all treatment groups.
T7	Premise 1706 1782	No iris pigmentation changes were observed in any patient during this study.
T8	Premise 1783 1983	There were no clinically or statistically significant changes from baseline in visual acuity, ocular cells and flare, fundus parameter, cup-to-disk ratio and visual field between the treatment groups.
T9	Premise 1984 2054	There were no serious adverse events reported for any treatment group.
