T1	Premise 1193 1327	Decreases in mean diurnal IOP from baseline were significantly greater for latanoprost than for non-PGs at months 6 and 12 (p < 0.01).
T2	Premise 1328 1389	No serious adverse events were judged to be treatment-related
T3	Premise 1391 1488	Mean total 36-month direct costs were similar in patients initiated with latanoprost and non-PGs.
T4	Premise 1489 1586	Patients who failed previous monotherapy remained on therapy longer when switched to latanoprost.
T5	Claim 1587 1677	The IOP-reducing effect of latanoprost and tolerability were sustained over the long term.
T6	Claim 1678 1782	Resource utilization and costs were generally similar in those initiating latanoprost or non-PG therapy.
