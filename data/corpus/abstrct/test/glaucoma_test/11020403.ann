T1	Premise 480 708	With a mean follow-up of 9.7 months, the trabeculectomy group had statistically lower intraocular pressures at weeks 6 to 15 (12.6 mm Hg vs 16.4 mm Hg) and months 11 to 13 (11.4 mm Hg vs 17.2 mm Hg) than the Ahmed implant group.
T2	Premise 709 890	Compared with preoperative status, no statistically significant differences between groups were noted for visual acuity, visual field, lens status, and final anterior chamber depth.
T3	Premise 891 1106	The cumulative probabilities of success (intraocular pressure <21 mm Hg and at least 15% reduction in intraocular pressure from preoperative level) were 83.6% for trabeculectomy and 88.1% for Ahmed implant (P =.43).
T4	Premise 1116 1188	the Ahmed implant group had a greater adjunctive medication requirement.
T5	Premise 1189 1321	On the last visit, 10 of the trabeculectomy eyes and 19 of the Ahmed implant eyes required at least one topical medication (P =.01).
T6	Premise 1425 1498	Lower mean intraocular pressures were noted for the trabeculectomy group.
T7	Premise 1499 1634	All other results, including success (as defined in this study) and frequency of complications, were comparable between the two groups.
T8	Premise 1322 1424	There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of complications between the two groups.
