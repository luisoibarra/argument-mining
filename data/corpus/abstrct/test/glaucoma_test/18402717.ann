T1	Premise 1041 1238	Adjunctive use of brimonidine purite provided greater IOP lowering than brinzolamide at 10 a.m. (p < 0.001) and 4 p.m. (p = 0.050) and equivalent IOP lowering to brinzolamide at 8 a.m. (p = 0.716).
T2	Premise 733 911	Baseline mean diurnal IOP (+/- standard deviation, mmHg) on latanoprost was comparable between groups (brimonidine purite: 19.6 +/- 2.94; brinzolamide: 19.8 +/- 3.25; p = 0.846).
T3	Premise 1239 1361	Blurred vision at Month 1 and bitter taste at Months 1 and 3 were more common upon instillation of brinzolamide eye drops.
T4	Claim 1362 1496	Brimonidine purite 0.1% provided significantly lower IOP compared with brinzolamide 1% when used as adjunctive therapy to latanoprost.
T5	Claim 1497 1543	Both adjunctive therapies were well tolerated.
T6	Premise 1544 1623	Limitations of this study include the use of a single site and the sample size.
T7	Claim 1624 1733	Additional studies are needed to further evaluate these drugs as adjunctive therapy to prostaglandin analogs.
