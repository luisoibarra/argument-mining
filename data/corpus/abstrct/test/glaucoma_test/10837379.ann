T4	Premise 620 698	The corresponding figures for dorzolamide were 27.2 (3.4) and 5.6 (2.6) mm Hg.
T3	Premise 513 619	After 3 months, latanoprost reduced mean baseline diurnal IOP from 27.2 (SD 3.0) mm Hg by 8.5 (3.3) mm Hg.
T5	Premise 699 786	The difference of 2.9 mm Hg (95% CI: 2.3-3.6) was highly significant (p<0.001, ANCOVA).
T7	Premise 952 1118	The corresponding figures at trough were 8.1 mm Hg (31%) for latanoprost and 4.7 mm Hg (17%) for dorzolamide, a significant difference of 3.4 mm Hg (p<0.001, ANCOVA).
T2	Claim 1119 1175	Both drugs were well tolerated systemically and locally.
T1	Claim 1176 1324	Latanoprost was superior to dorzolamide in reducing the IOP, judged both from the effect on IOP at peak and trough and by the effect on diurnal IOP.
T6	Premise 787 951	Latanoprost reduced IOP at peak by 8.6 mm Hg (32%) compared with 6.2 mm Hg (23%) for dorzolamide, and the difference of 2.4 mm Hg was significant (p<0.001, ANCOVA).
