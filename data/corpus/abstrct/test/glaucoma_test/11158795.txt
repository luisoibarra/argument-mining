To compare viscocanalostomy, a nonpenetrating procedure for glaucoma treatment, with trabeculectomy.
Randomized controlled trial.
Twenty white subjects (20 eyes) with open-angle glaucoma with no history of surgery were enrolled.
Ten subjects were randomly assigned to viscocanalostomy according to Stegmann's technique and 10 subjects to a modified Cairns trabeculectomy. A complete ophthalmologic examination was performed the day before surgery and postoperatively. Further visits were scheduled monthly for 6 to 8 months after surgery.
Success was defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) between 7 and 20 mmHg, with no medication.
After a mean follow-up of 6 months (range, 6-8 months), success was obtained in 5 of 10 cases in the trabeculectomy group and in 0 of 10 case in the viscocanalostomy group. With Kaplan-Meier's method, subjects with viscocanalostomy showed shorter postoperative IOP-reduction periods than subjects undergoing trabeculectomy.
According to the results of this short-term study, trabeculectomy was more effective than viscocanalostomy in lowering IOP in glaucomatous eyes of white patients.
