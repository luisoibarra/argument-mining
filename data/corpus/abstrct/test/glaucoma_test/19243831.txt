To compare phacoemulsification alone versus combined phacotrabeculectomy in medically uncontrolled chronic angle closure glaucoma (CACG) with coexisting cataract.
Prospective randomized clinical trial.
Fifty-one medically uncontrolled CACG eyes with coexisting cataract of 51 patients.
Recruited patients were randomized into group 1 (phacoemulsification alone) or group 2 (combined phacotrabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C). Postoperatively, patients were reviewed every 3 months for 2 years.
Intraocular pressure (IOP) and requirement for topical glaucoma drugs.
Twenty-seven CACG eyes were randomized into group 1, and 24 CACG eyes were randomized into group 2. Combined phacotrabeculectomy resulted in lower mean postoperative IOP than phacoemulsification alone at 3 months (14.0 vs 17.0 mmHg, P = 0.01), 15 months (13.2 vs 15.4 mmHg, P = 0.02), and 18 months (13.6 vs 15.9 mmHg, P = 0.01). Combined phacotrabeculectomy resulted in 1.25 fewer topical glaucoma drugs (P<0.001) in the 24-month postoperative period, compared with phacoemulsification alone. Combined surgery was associated with more postoperative complications (P<0.001) and more progression of optic neuropathy (P = 0.03), compared with phacoemulsification alone.
Combined phacotrabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C is more effective than phacoemulsification alone in controlling IOP in medically uncontrolled CACG eyes with coexisting cataract. Combined phacotrabeculectomy is associated with more postoperative complications.
