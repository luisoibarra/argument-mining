T2	Premise 879 1165	From an overall baseline mean intraocular pressure of 25.0 mm Hg, latanoprost monotherapy reduced mean diurnal intraocular pressure by 7.1 +/- 3.3 mm Hg (mean +/- SD, P < 0.001), whereas brimonidine monotherapy yielded an intraocular-pressure reduction of 5.2 +/- 3.5 mm Hg (P < 0.001).
T4	Premise 1166 1280	This 1.9 mm Hg difference in intraocular-pressure reduction was significantly in favor of latanoprost (P < 0.001).
T5	Premise 1281 1465	Ocular allergy (P < 0.001) and systemic side effects (P = 0.005) were reported significantly less frequently by latanoprost-treated patients compared with brimonidine-treated patients.
T6	Claim 1466 1605	Both latanoprost and brimonidine reduced intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension after 6 months of treatment.
T7	Claim 1606 1746	However, latanoprost once daily was significantly more effective than brimonidine twice daily in reducing mean diurnal intraocular pressure.
T1	Claim 1747 1852	Latanoprost was better tolerated with less frequently occurring ocular allergy and systemic side effects.
