T1	Claim 1279 1413	In eyes with open-angle glaucoma, viscocanalostomy is less effective in reducing intraocular pressure than standard filtering surgery.
T2	Premise 771 951	One day after surgery, mean (SD) intraocular pressure was 15.9 (5.2) for the trabeculectomy group (P <0.001) and 15.7 (3.6) for the viscocanalostomy group (P <0.001), respectively.
T3	Premise 952 1162	The success rate, defined as an intraocular pressure lower than 22 mm Hg without medication, was 56.7% in the trabeculectomy group and 30% in the viscocanalostomy group at 12 months postoperatively (P = 0.041).
T4	Premise 1163 1278	The number of postoperative complications was lower in the viscocanalostomy group than in the trabeculectomy group.
T5	Claim 1423 1493	postoperative complications are more frequent after filtering surgery.
