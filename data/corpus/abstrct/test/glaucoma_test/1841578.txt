We conducted a prospective, randomized study to compare mitomycin with fluorouracil for efficacy and safety as an adjunct to trabeculectomy in eyes with glaucoma with poor surgical prognosis. Thirty-two eyes of 32 patients were randomly allocated to either mitomycin (17 eyes) or fluorouracil therapy (15 eyes). Mitomycin (0.2 mg) was applied only once during trabeculectomy, and fluorouracil (5 mg) was subconjunctivally injected 10 times in the 2 weeks after surgery. Fifteen eyes (88%) in the mitomycin group and seven (47%) in the fluorouracil group achieved an intraocular pressure of less than or equal to 20 mm Hg without antiglaucoma medication. The follow-up period was 7 to 12 months. Corneal complications were less common in the group given mitomycin than in that given fluorouracil (12% vs 53%). The incidence of other complications was similar between the two groups.
