T1	Premise 811 912	For both treatments the diurnal IOP reduction after 6 months was statistically significant (P<0.001).
T2	Premise 913 1099	IOP (mean+/-SD) was reduced from 23.3+/-2.8 to 17.8+/-2.8 (-5.6) mmHg in the latanoprost 0.005% group and from 23.0+/-3.2 to 18.5+/-2.4 (-4.8) mmHg in pilocarpine 2% t.i.d.-treated eyes.
T3	Premise 1100 1277	The mean difference of -0.8 mmHg (per protocol, PP) and -1.6 mmHg (intend-to-treat, ITT) was statistically significant (P<0.04, PP; P<0.001, ITT) in favor of latanoprost 0.005%.
T4	Premise 1278 1340	Two eyes treated with latanoprost showed an iris color change.
T5	Premise 1341 1463	Thirty-six patients in the latanoprost group and 106 in the pilocarpine 2% group reported ocular adverse events (P<0.001).
T6	Claim 1464 1666	From the data we conclude that the additivity of latanoprost 0.005% is at least as effective as pilocarpine 2% t.i.d. in reducing IOP when added to eyes currently on monotherapy with timolol 0.5% b.i.d.
T7	Claim 1667 1744	Latanoprost was better tolerated than pilocarpine 2% eye drops in this study.
T8	Claim 1745 1810	The increase in iris pigmentation requires further investigation.
