T1	Claim 1527 1656	Our results suggest that OLO implant could be a new, safe, and effective alternative to MMC, with similar long-term success rate.
T2	Premise 1489 1526	No adverse reaction to OLO was noted.
T3	Premise 841 941	One-day postoperatively, the IOP dropped to 5.2 (±3.5) and 9.2 (±5.5) mm Hg, respectively (P=0.009).
T4	Premise 942 1095	The IOP reduction was significant at end point in all groups (P=0.01), with a mean IOP of 16.0 (±2.9) and 16.5 (±2.1) mm Hg in MMC and OLO, respectively.
T5	Premise 1096 1203	The rates and Kaplan-Meier curves did not differ for both complete and qualified success at any target IOP.
T6	Premise 1204 1266	The bleb height in OLO group was higher than MMC one (P<0.05).
T7	Premise 1267 1488	SD-OCT analysis of successful/unsuccessful bleb in patients with or without complete success at IOP =17  mm Hg indicated a sensitivity of 83% and 73% and a specificity of 75% and 67%, respectively, for MMC and OLO groups.
