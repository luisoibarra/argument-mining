T1	Premise 862 1142	The mean IOP in the first period when all patients were dosed in the evening was assessed 12 h after dosing at 09:00 and it was similar in the two treatment groups (mean +/- standard deviation: 17.9 +/- 2.7 mmHg for travoprost versus 17.7 +/- 2.5 mmHg for latanoprost, p = 0.812).
T2	Premise 1143 1322	In the a.m.-dosing crossover comparison, the 24-h post-dose IOP was significantly lower ( p < 0.001) on travoprost (16.9 +/- 3.1 mmHg) compared to latanoprost (18.6 +/- 3.3 mmHg).
T3	Claim 1382 1472	a.m.-dosed travoprost is superior to a.m.-dosed latanoprost by 1.7 mmHg at 24-h post-dose.
