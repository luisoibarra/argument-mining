T1	Premise 794 956	Latanoprost 0.005% once daily reduced IOP (+/- SEM) more effectively than latanoprost 0.0015% twice daily (9.8 +/- 0.9 mm Hg and 6.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, respectively).
T2	Premise 957 1134	There was a statistically significant increase in the aqueous humour protein concentration within the timolol group (P = 0.004), but not within the latanoprost group (P = 0.97).
T3	Premise 1304 1428	No statistically significant difference in conjunctival hyperemia between the two latanoprost regimens was found (P = 0.37).
T4	Claim 1634 1696	There was no difference in hyperemia between the two regimens.
T5	Claim 1697 1787	Both concentrations of latanoprost reduced IOP at least as well as timolol 0.5% eye drops.
T6	Premise 1429 1537	Latanoprost 0.005% once daily reduced IOP more effectively than latanoprost 0.0015% twice daily (P < 0.001).
T7	Premise 1135 1303	There was no statistically significant difference in the change in aqueous humour protein concentration from baseline between latanoprost and timolol groups (P = 0.08).
T8	Claim 1538 1633	Latanoprost had no statistically or clinically significant effect on the blood-aqueous barrier.
