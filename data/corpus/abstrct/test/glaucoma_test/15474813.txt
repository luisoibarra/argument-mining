To compare the efficacy and safety of viscocanalostomy and trabeculectomy in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).
Department of Ophthalmology, Ankara Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.
In this prospective randomized trial, 50 eyes of 50 patients with medically uncontrolled POAG were randomized to have a trabeculectomy (25 eyes) or a viscocanalostomy (25 eyes). Visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and slitlamp examinations were performed before surgery and 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 years postoperatively.
At 3 years, the mean IOP was 16.0 mmHg +/- 7.07 (SD) in the trabeculectomy group and 17.8 +/- 4.6 mmHg in the viscocanalostomy group (P=.694). Complete success (IOP 6 to 21 mm Hg without medication) was achieved in 66.2% of eyes at 6 months and 55.1% at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 52.9% and 35.3%, respectively, in the viscocanalostomy group (P>.05). Qualified success (IOP 6 to 21 mmHg with medication) was achieved in 95.8% of eyes at 6 months and 79.2% at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 90.7% and 73.9%, respectively, in the viscocanalostomy group (P>.05). Postoperative hypotony and cataract formation occurred more frequently in the trabeculectomy group than in the viscocanalostomy group (P=.002).
Primary trabeculectomy lowered IOP more than viscocanalostomy in POAG patients. However, the complication rate was lower in the viscocanalostomy group.
