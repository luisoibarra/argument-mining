T1	Premise 1002 1088	The incidences of postoperative complications were similar between groups (p = 0.232).
T2	Premise 1089 1312	No additional IOP-lowering surgical procedures were required in the combined group, while 13 (54%) eyes in the trabeculectomy group required either cataract extraction or further IOP-lowering surgical procedures (p <0.001).
T3	Claim 1313 1498	In patients with PACG, the long-term IOP-lowering effect and surgical complications of combined trabeculectomy and cataract extraction are comparable with those of trabeculectomy alone.
T4	Claim 1499 1578	However, the combined surgery incurred fewer subsequent surgical interventions.
