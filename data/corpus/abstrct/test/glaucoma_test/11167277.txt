To compare the effect on intraocular pressure of latanoprost versus timolol plus dorzolamide in open-angle glaucoma.
Thirty-five patients with open-angle glaucoma were randomized, 18 to latanoprost once daily and 17 to timolol plus dorzolamide twice daily. Intraocular pressure and ocular side effects were recorded at baseline, and after 2 weeks and 3 months of treatment.
Latanoprost reduced the intraocular pressure 1.09 and 1.58 mm Hg more than timolol plus dorzolamide after 2 weeks and 3 months of treatment, respectively. These differences were statistically significant (p<0.05) at the end of the study. After 3 months of treatment, 32.3% of the eyes in the latanoprost group reduced the intraocular pressure in 30% or more with respect to baseline, while 15.6% of the eyes in the timolol plus dorzolamide group achieved this reduction.
Latanoprost administered once daily reduced the intraocular pressure at least as well as timolol plus dorzolamide twice daily in patients with open-angle glaucoma.
