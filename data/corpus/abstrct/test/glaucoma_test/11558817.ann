T1	Premise 960 1046	The diurnal intraocular pressure reduction was significant in both groups (P < 0.001).
T2	Premise 1047 1195	The mean intraocular pressure reduction from baseline was 32% for the latanoprost plus timolol group and 20% for the dorzolamide plus timolol group.
T3	Premise 1196 1408	The least square estimate of the mean diurnal intraocular pressure reduction after 3 months was -7.06 mm Hg in the latanoprost plus timolol group and -4.44 mm Hg in the dorzolamide plus timolol group (P < 0.001).
T4	Claim 1409 1473	Drugs administered in both treatment groups were well tolerated.
T5	Claim 1474 1646	This study clearly showed that the additive diurnal intraocular pressure-lowering effect of latanoprost is superior to that of dorzolamide in patients treated with timolol.
