T1	Premise 1031 1300	After 1 month of treatment, latanoprost significantly reduced intraocular pressure (mean +/- SEM) by 6.1 +/- 0.5 mm Hg (P <.001) and unoprostone by 4.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg (P <.001) adjusted from an overall baseline of 22.3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg and 23.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, respectively.
T2	Premise 1301 1445	The difference of 1.9 mm Hg between treatments was statistically significant in favor of latanoprost [P =.003, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)].
T3	Premise 1446 1658	Unadjusted analysis of responders using the percentage decrease in intraocular pressure showed that the proportion of responders in the latanoprost-treated group was greater than in the unoprostone-treated group.
T4	Premise 1659 1731	Adverse ocular symptoms and findings were mild in both treatment groups.
T5	Premise 1732 1807	Eye redness and ocular irritation were the most frequently reported events.
T6	Claim 1808 2031	Latanoprost once daily was significantly more effective in reducing intraocular pressure compared with unoprostone twice daily after 1 month of treatment in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.
T7	Claim 2032 2094	Both drugs were well tolerated with few ocular adverse events.
