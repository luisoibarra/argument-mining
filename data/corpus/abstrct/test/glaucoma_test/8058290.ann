T1	Premise 640 778	Of patients with 350- and 500-mm2 implants, 93% and 88%, respectively, achieved surgical success (18-month life-table analysis, P = 0.93).
T2	Premise 779 903	The 500-mm2 implants afforded intraocular pressure control with significantly fewer medications (0.7 versus 1.3; P = 0.006).
T3	Premise 904 1094	The postoperative visual acuities remained within one line of the preoperative visual acuities or improved in 62% and 66% of patients in the 350- and 500-mm2 groups, respectively (P = 0.93).
T4	Claim 1095 1141	Complication rates were statistically similar.
T5	Claim 1362 1535	The intermediate-term results of the 350- and 500-mm2 Baerveldt implants were statistically comparable with respect to surgical and visual outcomes, as well as complications
T6	Claim 1537 1621	although the larger implant was associated with a higher rate of some complications.
T7	Claim 1631 1747	the 500-mm2 Baerveldt implant afforded intraocular pressure control with fewer medications than the 350-mm2 implant.

T8	Premise 1142 1361	The most frequent ones in the 350- and 500-mm2 groups, respectively, were serous choroidal effusion (16% and 32%), strabismus (16% and 19%), anterior uveitis (14% and 11%), and corneal or corneal graft edema (11% each).
