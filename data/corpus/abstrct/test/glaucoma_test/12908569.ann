T1	Claim 2524 2588	It has a safe systemic profile with minimum effect on the heart.
T2	Premise 892 1018	The IOP readings after treatment were significantly lower than their baseline levels in both groups at all visits (p < 0.001).
T3	Premise 771 891	At baseline, the mean IOP was 24.48 +/- 2.29 mmHg in the brimonidine group and 23.32 +/- 0.82 mmHg in the timolol group.
T4	Premise 1019 1200	At peak, the mean decreases from the baseline IOP ranged from 5.22 +/- 0.30 mmHg to 6.96 +/- 0.33 mmHg for brimonidine and from 4.55 +/- 0.49 mmHg to 6.64 +/- 0.53 mmHg for timolol.
T5	Premise 1201 1371	At trough, the mean decreases from baseline ranged from 3.72 +/- 0.32 mmHg to 4.55 +/- 0.32 mmHg for brimonidine and 3.82 +/- 0.52 mmHg to 4.27 +/- 0.51 mmHg for timolol.
T6	Premise 1456 1621	The clinical success rate was 86.2% in the brimonidine group and 81.8% in the timolol group, making no statistically significant difference between them (p = 0.817).
T7	Premise 1622 1725	17.2% of patients in brimonidine group and 9.0% patients in timolol group reported mild adverse events.
T8	Premise 1726 1792	Ocular allergy occurred in 10.3% of patients in brimonidine group.
T9	Premise 1793 1895	No significant changes in visual acuity, biomicroscopy or ophthalmoscopy were observed in both groups.
T10	Premise 1896 1980	Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained relatively stable in both groups
T11	Premise 2234 2361	Patients receiving timolol experienced statistically significant mean heart rate decreases from baseline (p = 0.020) in week 4.
T12	Claim 2362 2523	Topically applied twice daily for one month, brimonidine tartrate 0.2% has clinical effectiveness equivalent to timolol 0.5% in Taiwanese patients with glaucoma.
T13	Premise 2141 2233	The mean heart rate in the brimonidine group was relatively unchanged over the study period.
