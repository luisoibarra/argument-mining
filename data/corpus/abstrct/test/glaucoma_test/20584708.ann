T2	Premise 680 845	There was no statistically significant difference between ECD reduction in group BSS Plus 13.1 ± 2.0% and Ringer 9.2 ± 1.9% (p<0.05) at day 60 or in any study visit.
T3	Premise 846 1010	There was no statistically significant difference between CV increase in group BSS Plus 23.0 ± 3.0% and Ringer 20.2 ± 4.0% (p<0.05) at day 60 or in any study visit.
T4	Premise 1011 1141	CCT was significantly increased (p<0.05) at 1, 8, 15 and 30 days postoperatively, returning to baseline at 60 days in both groups.
T5	Premise 1142 1222	There was no significant difference in CCT increase in both groups at any visit.
T6	Premise 1238 1451	there were statistically significant correlations between ECD loss and phacoemulsification time (p<0.0001) and ECD loss and irrigation solution volume (p<0.0001) in the Ringer group, but not in the BSS Plus group.
T7	Claim 1452 1549	Ringers solution was similar to BSS Plus for corneal preservation in atraumatic cataract surgery.
T1	Claim 1550 1756	However, our study demonstrates that there is a trend towards lower postoperative endothelial cell density for surgeries with longer phacoemulsification time and higher irrigation volumes if Ringer is used.
