T1	Premise 817 914	Intraocular pressure was significantly reduced during the entire follow-up period in both groups.
T2	Premise 915 1088	In the long-acting drug group, the reduction of intraocular pressure was -3.5 +/- 0.2, -4.3 +/- 0.2 and -4.6 +/- 0.3 mmHg at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, respectively (paired t test).
T3	Claim 1257 1406	The safety profile was similar in both groups, and the tolerance for the long-acting eye drops was as good as for the currently-prescribed eye drops.
T4	Claim 1492 1603	the long-acting eye drops seem to be an efficacious formulation for clinical use in Japanese glaucoma patients.
T5	Claim 1407 1491	Because the efficacy of both drugs was equivalent, with an identical safety profile,
