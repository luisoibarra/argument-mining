T2	Claim 1745 1927	Brinzolamide produced less ocular discomfort (burning/stinging) than timolol, and total carbonic anhydrase inhibition levels remained below that known to cause systemic side effects.
T3	Claim 1928 2063	Brinzolamide produced significant and equivalent reductions in intraocular pressure when dosed two and three times daily for 18 months.
T4	Claim 2064 2149	Brinzolamide was safe and well tolerated by patients, with minimal ocular discomfort.
T5	Premise 966 1185	Mean changes in intraocular pressure trough measurements ranged from -2.7 to -3.9 mm Hg with brinzolamide twice-daily dosing and -2.8 to -3.8 mm Hg three times daily dosing compared with -4.7 to -5.6 mm Hg with timolol.
T6	MajorClaim 2 99	Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors used to treat glaucoma have significant systemic side effects.
T7	Premise 839 965	All regimens produced clinically relevant and statistically significant (P<.05) intraocular pressure reductions from baseline.
