T1	Claim 2824 2941	Significantly more patients achieved clinical success with brimonidine monotherapy than with latanoprost monotherapy.
T2	Premise 1375 1545	After 3 months of treatment, 80% of patients in the brimonidine group and 74% of patients in the latanoprost group had achieved > or = 20% reduction in IOP from baseline.
T3	Premise 1546 1690	The mean reduction in IOP from baseline at month 3 was 6.8 mm Hg with brimonidine and 6.5 mm Hg with latanoprost (27.8% vs 27.0%, respectively).
T4	Premise 1691 1905	Among treatment-naive patients, a significantly higher percentage of brimonidine-treated patients achieved > or = 20% decrease in IOP compared with latanoprost-treated patients (88% vs 59%, respectively; P = 0.01).
T5	Premise 1906 2083	In previously treated patients, a higher percentage of the latanoprost group achieved > or = 20% reduction in IOP compared with the brimonidine group (88% vs 74%, respectively);
T6	Premise 2143 2304	Significantly more patients in the brimonidine group achieved clinical success at month 3 compared with patients in the latanoprost group (91% vs 74%; P = 0.01).
T7	Premise 2305 2404	At peak effect, brimonidine twice daily was as effective as latanoprost once daily in lowering IOP.
T8	Premise 2405 2563	In treatment-naive patients, latanoprost was associated with a significantly higher rate of nonresponse after 3 months of treatment compared with brimonidine.
T9	Claim 2564 2712	This suggests that brimonidine may be the more reliable choice for first-line therapy of newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
T10	Premise 2713 2823	In previously treated patients, however, latanoprost provided greater mean IOP reduction than did brimonidine.
T11	Premise 2084 2142	however, the difference was not statistically significant.
