T2	Premise 1229 1328	At 1 year, IOP in both treatment groups was statistically significantly lower from baseline values.
T3	Premise 1329 1451	Sixty-six percent of treatment eyes versus 48% of control eyes achieved =20% IOP reduction without medication (P = 0.003).

T5	Claim 1565 1804	Pressure reduction on fewer medications was clinically and statistically significantly better 1 year after stent plus cataract surgery versus cataract surgery alone, with an overall safety profile similar to that of cataract surgery alone.
