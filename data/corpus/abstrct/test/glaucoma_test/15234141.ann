T1	Claim 1433 1592	Both Baerveldt and Ahmed glaucoma drainage implants performed well in terms of IOP control, preservation of visual function, and having low complication rates.
T2	Premise 659 886	Both drainage implants achieved remarkable reductions in IOP; from pretreatment IOP of 40.1+/-13.8 mmHg and 43.7+/-9.3 mmHg to postoperative IOP of 17.4+/-6.2 and 14.9+/-5.5 mmHg in the Baerveldt and Ahmed groups, respectively.
T4	Premise 887 942	A decrease in IOP of 56.6% and 65.9% had been achieved.
T5	Premise 943 1108	Success rates were 20 (83.3%) for Baerveldt and 12 (66.7%) for Ahmed implants, whereas qualified success occurred in 1 (4.2%) Baerveldt and 3 (16.7%) Ahmed implants.
T7	Premise 1109 1214	Conversely, failure to control IOP occurred in 3 (12.5%) Baerveldt implants and 3 (16.7%) Ahmed implants.
T8	Premise 1215 1432	More than 80% of the patients had maintained or improved visual function, whereas only 4 (16.0%) of the patients with Baerveldt implants and 2 (16.7%) patients with Ahmed implants had loss of more than 1 Snellen line.
