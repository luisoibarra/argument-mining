T1	Premise 831 933	Clinical success was 71% (75/106) with brimonidine and 70% (73/105) with timolol as initial treatment.
T2	Premise 934 1025	The overall mean decrease in IOP was 6.5 mm Hg with brimonidine and 6.2 mm Hg with timolol.
T3	Premise 1026 1072	Few patients reported a specific adverse event
T4	Premise 1078 1232	with the exception of a slightly higher rate of ocular burning and stinging in the brimonidine group, there were no significant between-group differences.
T5	Premise 1233 1308	No significant chronotropic effects on the heart were seen with brimonidine
T6	Premise 1316 1408	small but significant mean decreases in heart rate were seen at months 1 and 4 with timolol.
T7	Premise 1409 1494	Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained relatively stable in both groups.
T8	Premise 1495 1574	Quality of life remained stable, with no significant between-group differences.
T9	Claim 1575 1761	As a first-line agent for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, brimonidine has clinical effectiveness equivalent to timolol, but with less chronotropic effect on the heart.
