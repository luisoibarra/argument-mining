T1	Claim 1270 1435	Latanoprost administered once daily was significantly more effective in reducing IOP compared with unoprostone administered twice daily in patients with POAG and OH.
T2	Premise 752 879	From an overall baseline of 24.1 mmHg, latanoprost reduced IOP by 6.7 mmHg (28%) and unoprostone reduced IOP by 3.3 mmHg (14%).
T3	Premise 880 1047	The difference between the groups of 3.4 mmHg was significant (P: < 0.001, analysis of covariance; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.7 to -2.1) in favor of latanoprost.
T4	Premise 1048 1194	A >/=30% reduction in mean IOP from baseline was achieved by 44% of latanoprost-treated patients compared with 8% of unoprostone-treated patients.
