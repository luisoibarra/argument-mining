T1	Premise 914 1091	At month 6, the adjusted mean (+/- SEM) diurnal IOP reduction was 5.7 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in the latanoprost group and 3.1 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in patients receiving brimonidine (P < 0.001).
T2	Premise 1092 1189	The mean difference in diurnal IOP reduction was 2.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.9, 3.2; P < 0.001).
T3	Premise 1190 1306	Five times more patients receiving brimonidine than latanoprost were withdrawn from the study due to adverse events.
T4	Claim 1307 1488	Latanoprost instilled once daily is more effective and better tolerated than brimonidine administered twice daily for the treatment of patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
T5	Claim 1489 1593	During therapy, the range of daily fluctuation of IOP is less for latanoprost compared with brimonidine.
