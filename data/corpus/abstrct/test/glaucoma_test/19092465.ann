T1	Premise 1167 1277	Mean diurnal IOP reduction after 8 weeks were 7.02+/-3.06 mm Hg and 6.91+/-3.67 mm Hg, respectively (P=0.811).
T2	Premise 1278 1396	The adjusted difference between groups (analysis of covariance) at week 8 was not statistically significant (P=0.847).
T3	Premise 1761 1839	No statistical difference in terms of adverse events was found between groups.
T5	Claim 1996 2061	both fixed combinations are well tolerated with few side effects.
T6	Premise 1397 1532	Mean baseline WDT peak was 27.79+/-4.29 mm Hg in the brimonidine/timolol group and 27.68+/-5.46 mm Hg in the dorzolamide/timolol group.
T4	Claim 1840 1989	Both fixed combinations were capable of significantly reducing the mean diurnal IOP, mean diurnal peak, and mean WDT peak after 8 weeks of treatment.
