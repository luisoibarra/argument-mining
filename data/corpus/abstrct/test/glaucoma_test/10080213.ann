T1	Premise 1330 1511	Compared with baseline measurements, both latanoprost and timolol caused a significant (P < 0.001) reduction of IOP at each hour of diurnal curve throughout the duration of therapy.
T2	Premise 1512 1659	Reduction of IOP was 6.0 +/- 4.5 and 5.9 +/- 4.6 with latanoprost and 4.8 +/- 3.0 and 4.6 +/- 3.1 with timolol after 6 and 12 months, respectively.
T3	Premise 1660 1808	Comparison of mean diurnal measurements with latanoprost and timolol showed a statistical significant (P < 0.001) difference at 3, 6, and 12 months.
T4	Premise 1809 1939	Mean C was found to be significantly enhanced (+30%) only in the latanoprost-treated group compared with the baseline (P = 0.017).
T5	Premise 1940 2046	Mean conjunctival hyperemia was graded at 0.3 in latanoprost-treated eyes and 0.2 in timolol-treated eyes.
T6	Premise 2047 2205	A remarkable change in iris color was observed in both eyes of 1 of the 18 patients treated with latanoprost and none of the 18 patients who received timolol.
T7	Premise 2302 2430	In the timolol group, heart rate was significantly reduced from 72 +/- 9 at baseline to 67 +/- 10 beats per minute at 12 months.
T8	Claim 2593 2757	in patients with pigmentary glaucoma, 0.005% latanoprost taken once daily was well tolerated and more effective in reducing IOP than 0.5% timolol taken twice daily.
T9	Claim 2440 2592	further studies may need to confirm these data on a larger sample and to evaluate the side effect of increased iris pigmentation on long-term follow-up,
