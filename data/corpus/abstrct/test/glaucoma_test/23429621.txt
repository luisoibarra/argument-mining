To compare the efficacy of bimatoprost/timolol (BTFC) or travoprost/timolol (TTFC) fixed combinations on intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction in an Egyptian population.
Patients with primary open angle glaucoma were randomized to receive either BTFC or TTFC. IOPs were measured at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 months. The primary outcome measure was the mean change in IOP from baseline at each visit. Secondary outcome measures included the incidence of adverse events.
Eighty patients (80 eyes) were included finally: 40 eyes in each group. Baseline mean IOPs were 24.78±3.53 and 25.26±3.51 mm Hg for BTFC and TTFC, respectively (P=0.344). Both drops provided statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline at all visits (P<0.001). BTFC provided greater significant mean IOP reductions from baseline than TTFC at each visit (P<0.001). Mean IOP reductions were 11.34 and 6.42 mm Hg at 2 weeks (P=0.000), and 11.17 and 7.89 mmHg at 6 months (P=0.001) for BTFC and TTFC, respectively. IOPs at 2 weeks were 18 mm Hg in 36 (90.8%) versus 22 (55%) eyes and 16 mm Hg in 28 (70%) versus 16 (40%) eyes (P<0.001), and at 6 months, 18 mm Hg in 38 (95%) versus 28 (70%) eyes and 16 mm Hg in 30 (75%) versus 18 (45%) eyes for BTFC and TTFC, respectively (P<0.001).
Both drops provided effective IOP reduction that was greater and patients were more likely to achieve lower target pressures with BTFC than with TTFC.
