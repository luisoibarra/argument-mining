T1	Premise 862 1009	The mean IOP levels of latanoprost/timolol (13.83, SD = 2.54) was significantly lower than of bimatoprost (16.16, SD = 3.28; P < 0.0001) at week 8.
T2	Premise 1016 1181	the change in mean IOP values was significantly higher in the latanoprost/timolol group at 10:00 am (P = 0.013) and 12:00 pm (P = 0.01), but not at 8:00 am (P = ns).
T3	Premise 1317 1401	there was a significant decrease in mean heart rate in the latanoprost/timolol group
T4	Premise 1412 1504	no significant changes in blood pressure and lung spirometry were observed in either groups.
T5	Claim 1505 1643	The fixed combination of latanoprost/timolol was significantly superior to bimatoprost alone in reducing IOP in patients with POAG or OHT.
T6	Claim 1644 1813	Further studies with large sample sizes should be taken to support the superior efficacy of latanoprost/timolol, as well as to better assess its profile of side effects.
