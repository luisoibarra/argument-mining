T1	MajorClaim 45 148	octreotide, the long acting somatostatin analogue, improves survival of animals with pancreatic cancer.
T2	Premise 632 906	The patients treated with octreotide showed a significant advantage in quality of life (restored appetite, improvement of digestion and intestine function, remission of abdominal pain and preservation of baseline body weight) with a mean > 80 of karnofsky performance score.
T3	Premise 907 1040	Monitoring of tumour size changes (US-TC) over the 6 months study period, showed slackened neoplastic growth in all treated patients,
T4	Premise 1041 1125	whereas neoplasm grew according to an almost exponential trend in untreated patients
T5	Premise 1132 1171	survival was better in treated patients
T6	Premise 1329 1396	Karnofsky performance score was particularly high in both patients.
T7	Claim 1425 1479	octreotide is endowed with antiproliferative activity.
T8	Claim 1494 1607	octreotide therapy seems to confer a survival benefit and a better quality of life in advanced pancreatic tumour.
