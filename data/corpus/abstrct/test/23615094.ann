T1	Premise 1015 1159	Serviceable hearing was lost in 54 of 71 (76%) (CM) and 34 of 53 (64%) (GKRS) patients during the study period (not significant, log-rank test).
T2	Premise 1160 1238	There was a significant reduction in tumor volume over time in the GKRS group.
T3	Premise 1239 1355	The need for treatment following initial GKRS or CM differed at highly significant levels (log-rank test, P < .001).
T4	Premise 1356 1432	Symptom and QoL development did not differ significantly between the groups.
T5	Claim 1433 1546	In VS patients, GKRS reduces the tumor growth rate and thereby the incidence rate of new treatment about tenfold.
T6	Claim 1547 1595	Hearing is lost at similar rates in both groups.
T7	Claim 1596 1659	Symptoms and QoL seem not to be significantly affected by GKRS.
