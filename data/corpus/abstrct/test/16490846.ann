T1	Premise 946 1185	Compared with surgical excision, the total treatment costs of MMS are significantly higher (cost difference: primary BCC, 254 euros; 95% confidence interval, 181-324 euros; recurrent BCC, 249 euros; 95% confidence interval, 175-323 euros).
T2	Premise 1186 1319	For primary BCC, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 29,231 euros, while the ratio for recurrent BCC amounted to 8094 euros.
T3	Premise 1320 1465	The acceptability curves showed that for these ratios, the probability of MMS being more cost-effective than surgical excision never reached 50%.
T4	Claim 1466 1579	At present, it does not seem cost-effective to introduce MMS on a large scale for both primary and recurrent BCC.
T5	Premise 1589 1672	because a 5-year period is normally required to determine definite recurrence rates
T6	Claim 1674 1754	it is possible that MMS may become a cost-effective treatment for recurrent BCC.
