T1	Premise 696 814	A beneficial effect of MPA on appetite was observed after both 6 weeks (P = .008) and 12 weeks (P = .01) of treatment.
T2	Premise 815 963	After 12 weeks, a mean weight gain of 0.6 +/- 4.4 kg was seen in the MPA, versus an ongoing mean weight loss of 1.4 +/- 4.6 kg in the placebo group.
T3	Premise 964 1030	This difference of 2.0 kg was statistically significant (P = .04).
T4	Premise 1031 1113	During the study, several areas of QL deteriorated in the total group of patients.
T5	Claim 1114 1285	With the exception of an improvement in appetite and possible also a reduction in nausea and vomiting, no measurable beneficial effects of MPA on QL could be demonstrated.
T6	Premise 1286 1413	The side effects profile of MPA was favorable: only a trend toward an increase in (usually mild) peripheral edema was observed.
T7	Claim 1414 1601	In weight-losing, advanced-stage non-hormone-sensitive cancer patients, MPA exhibits a mild side effects profile, has a beneficial effect on appetite, and may prevent further weight loss.
T8	Claim 1602 1690	However, general QL in the present study was not measurably influenced by MPA treatment.
