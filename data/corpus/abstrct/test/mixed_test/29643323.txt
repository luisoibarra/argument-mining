Treatment-related quality of life (QOL) is an important aspect of diabetes management. However, no studies have compared the influence of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors versus alpha-glucosidase inhibitors on treatment-related QOL. This prespecified sub-analysis of the Linagliptin Study of Effects on Postprandial blood glucose (L-STEP) compared the effects of linagliptin (5 mg once daily) and voglibose (0.2 mg/meal thrice daily) on treatment-related QOL in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) inadequately controlled with diet and exercise therapy. Among 366 subjects in the original study, 182 in the linagliptin group and 173 in the voglibose group were included in this analysis. The outcome of this study was change in QOL as assessed by the Diabetes Therapy-Related Quality of Life 17 (DTR-QOL17) questionnaire from baseline to week 12. Compared with baseline data, total DTR-QOL17 scores were significantly higher after 12 weeks of linagliptin and voglibose treatment. The change in the total DTR-QOL17 score and the score of one domain, burden on social activities and daily activities, was significantly greater in the linagliptin group than in the voglibose group. In addition, only linagliptin treatment was identified as a factor associated with an increased total DTR-QOL17 score. Linagliptin is superior to voglibose in terms of improving treatment-related QOL in Japanese patients with T2DM.
