T1	Premise 795 923	The mean postoperative IOP was statistically significantly lower than the mean preoperative IOP at each follow-up in each group.
T2	Premise 924 997	At 1 year, the mean postoperative IOP was significantly lower in group A.
T3	Premise 998 1106	According to the MBGS, blebs with an ologen implant showed significantly better scoring than those with MMC.
T4	Premise 1107 1226	AS-OCT showed that ologen-induced blebs had significantly more fluid-filled spaces, cleavage planes, and less fibrosis.
T5	Claim 1227 1333	Ologen resulted in a lower long-term postoperative IOP, a better bleb morphology, and fewer complications.
T6	MajorClaim 1334 1409	Our results suggest that ologen may be a useful alternative to MMC in JOAG.
