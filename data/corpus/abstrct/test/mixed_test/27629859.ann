T1	MajorClaim 0 215	In patients with chronic hepatitis B, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) for 48-weeks results in higher rates of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss than either monotherapy.
T2	Premise 818 995	Rates of HBsAg loss at Week 72 were significantly higher in the TDF/PI-48w group (6.5%) than in the TDF/PI-16w+TDF-32w (0.5%), TDF-120w (0%) and PI-48w (2.2%) groups (P = 0.09).
T3	Premise 1062 1160	HBsAg decline at Week 12 or 24 of treatment was associated with HBsAg loss at Week 72 (P < 0.001).
T5	Premise 1161 1339	HBsAg decline >3.5 log10 IU/mL at Week 24 in the TDF/PI-48w group resulted in a positive predictive value of 85% and a negative predictive value of 99% for HBsAg loss at Week 72.
T6	Claim 1340 1528	HBsAg decline at Week 24 of TDF plus PEG-IFN combination therapy may identify patients who, after completing 48 weeks of treatment, have a better chance of achieving HBsAg loss at Week 72.
