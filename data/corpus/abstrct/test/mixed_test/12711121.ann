T1	Premise 839 974	Both patients with objective response and disease stabilisation had clearly better symptom control than those with disease progression.
T2	Premise 975 1092	Symptom control in both arms was similar for 'disease-specific' symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, pain or haemoptysis.
T3	Premise 1093 1331	Compared to PV, a significantly larger number of GEM-patients had better scores for 'constitutional' items such as anorexia (P=0.007), ability to carry on with daily activities (P=0.04) and overall impression of quality-of-life (P=0.008).
T4	Premise 1332 1509	Symptom control was very similar in younger (<65 years) versus older (>/=65 years) patients, and only slightly better in those with a Karnofsky PS >/=80% compared to those <80%.
T5	Premise 1510 1656	Most of the symptom improvement occurred in the first 3 cycles, with some further symptom improvement in the following cycles in the GEM-arm only.
T6	Claim 1657 1755	Both GEM and PV yield a symptom control rate much higher than expected by the objective tumour RR.
T7	Claim 1756 1879	GEM is equally effective in controlling 'disease-specific' symptoms, but superior in controlling 'constitutional' symptoms.
T9	Premise 1880 2022	Most of the symptom control was achieved during the first 3 cycles of treatment, with some further improvement thereafter in the GEM-arm only.
