T1	Premise 799 888	Large-scale clinical trials have shown that incretin-based therapies mitigate albuminuria
T2	Premise 889 935	but have not shown beneficial effects on eGFR.
T3	Premise 936 1151	Research on the incretin-based therapies has yielded a diverse array of direct effects throughout the body, which fuels speculation as to how these drugs might benefit the diabetic kidney and affect its function(s).
T4	Premise 1152 1358	But in vivo experiments have yet to confirm that the proposed mechanisms underlying emergent phenomena, such as proximal tubular fluid reabsorption, are the ones predicted by cell and molecular experiments.
T5	Claim 1359 1441	There may be salutary effects of incretin-based treatments on the diabetic kidney,
T6	Claim 1442 1527	but the system is complex and not amenable to simple explanation or prior prediction.
T7	Claim 1528 1620	This contrasts with the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, which can be explained concisely.
