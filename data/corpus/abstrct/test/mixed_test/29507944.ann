T1	Premise 1665 1874	The mean (SD) systolic BP decreased by 8 (12) mm Hg in the standard group and by 27 (17) mm Hg in the intensive group (P < .001), with mean (SD) achieved pressures of 141 (13) and 126 (10) mm Hg, respectively.
T2	Premise 1875 2117	Change in global perfusion did not differ between treatment groups: the mean (SD) change was -0.5 (9.4) mL/min/100 g in the standard group vs 0.7 (8.6) mL/min/100 g in the intensive group (partial η2, 0.004; 95% CI, -3.551 to 5.818; P = .63).
T3	Premise 2118 2245	No differences were observed when the analysis examined gray or white matter only or was confined to those achieving target BP.
T4	Claim 2422 2509	Intensive BP lowering did not reduce cerebral perfusion in severe small vessel disease.
T5	Premise 2246 2421	The number of adverse events did not differ between treatment groups, with a mean (SD) of 0.21 (0.65) for the standard group and 0.32 (0.75) for the intensive group (P = .44).
