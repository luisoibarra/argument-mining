T1	Premise 786 998	At two year follow-up there was a significant group by time interaction showing lower Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CESD) scores in the SSRI + CCB group, F(1,291) = 4.13, p = 0.043, η2 p = 0.014.
T2	Premise 999 1271	Over ten-years follow-up, SSRI + CCB use was associated with improved general cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination: β = 0.97; 95% CI 0.14 to 1.81, p = 0.023) and immediate visual memory (Boston Visual Retention Test: β = 0.69; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.32, p = 0.033).
T3	Claim 1272 1399	The findings provide general population evidence that SSRI augmentation with CCB may improve depression and cognitive function.
