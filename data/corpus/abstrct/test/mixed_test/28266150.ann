T1	Premise 827 1051	At the end of the 2-year follow-up period, the complete success and the failure rates were 67% and 15%, respectively, in the microcatheter-assisted group versus 47% and 50% in the rigid probe trabeculotomy group (p = 0.006).
T2	Premise 1052 1249	There was a tendency towards lower IOP in the microcatheter group at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively, with the difference in IOP reaching statistical significance at 6 months (p = 0.004).
T3	Premise 1250 1337	The mean survival time was significantly longer for the microcatheter group (p = 0.01).
T4	Claim 1338 1521	At 2 years postoperatively, microcatheter-assisted trabeculotomy still yielded superior results in terms of IOP control and success rates in children with primary congenital glaucoma.
T5	Premise 1522 1611	The need for reoperation for glaucoma was significantly lower in the microcatheter group.
