T1	Claim 1616 1831	Vesatolimod was safe and well-tolerated in patients with CHB, demonstrating consistent dose-dependent pharmacodynamic induction of ISG15 without significant systemic induction of IFNα expression or related symptoms.
T2	Premise 1017 1120	Most (41-80%) experienced ≥1 AE during the study with the majority of AEs mild or moderate in severity.
T3	Premise 1121 1241	No significant declines in HBsAg were observed at the primary (Week 24) or secondary endpoints (Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 48).
T4	Premise 1242 1389	ISG15 induction was dose-dependent and consistent after repeat dosing, returning closer to baseline by one week after treatment at all dose levels;
T5	Premise 1390 1494	no patient demonstrated significant serum interferon alpha (IFNα) expression at any timepoint evaluated.
T6	Premise 1495 1615	Multivariate analyses showed that ≥2-fold ISG15 induction is associated with 2- or 4-mg vesatolimod dose and female sex.
