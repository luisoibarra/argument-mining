T1	Premise 949 1084	Compared with baseline, IOP drop at last visit was 11.76±5.51 and 13.43±5.92 in the bevacizumab and MMC groups, respectively (P=0.207).
T2	Premise 1085 1211	At last visit, complete success was achieved in 25 cases (61%) of bevacizumab group and 23 cases (66%) of MMC group (P=0.669).
T3	Premise 1212 1292	Early filtering bleb leak was more prevalent in bevacizumab group (29% vs. 11%).
T4	Claim 1293 1402	A single 1.25 mg dose of intracameral bevacizumab improves the success of trabeculectomy comparable with MMC;
T5	Claim 1403 1466	however, it increases the risk of early filtering bleb leakage.
