The hepatitis B is most prevalent diseases (along with morbidities) in Asian countries. This research study has been conducted to provide an alternative treatment which is safe, effective and cost-effective to comprehend relations of disease, symptoms, patients response and the clinical response via better management of hepatitis B. The goal of this research is to evaluate efficacy and safety of herbal medicine as compared to allopathic medicine in patients suffering from hepatitis B. This was a single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at Shifa-ul-Mulk Memorial Hospital Hamdard University, Karachi and Dar ul Shifa Unani Dawakhana Karachi, Pakistan. The patients of both genders ranging from 25 to 50 years with symptoms and diagnosed for hepatitis B that fulfilled the criteria for membership, and consented for participation were registered. Ethical committee clearance and permission was obtained from the concerned committee at Faculty of Eastern Medicine, Hamdard University, Karachi, Pakistan. No significant difference was identified after treatment and it was found that the efficacy of Alpha (Control drug) is same as Safoof akseer e jigar (Test drug). The data offered support to the null hypothesis and therefore research hypothesis was rejected. According to the statistical analysis by chi square, hepatitis B was recorded as negative in 26 patients (57.77%) out of 45 patients by the use of Interferon Alpha (control therapy) and in 27 patients (64.28%) out of 42 patients by the use of Safoof akseer e jigar (test drug). Comparison of the data recorded of the patients was determined as both drugs showed significant improvement and p value>0.05. The efficacy response is equal in both drugs while test drug showed more safety response. It is concluded that Safoof akseer e jigar possesses as effective a therapeutic value in treating hepatitis B as allopathic medicine.
