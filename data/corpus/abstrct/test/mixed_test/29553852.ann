T1	MajorClaim 0 61	Hypertension is a generally accepted atherogenic risk factor.
T2	Premise 982 1195	The results showed that mean c-IMT z-scores increased significantly during 4 years (0.002 ± 0.003, p < 0.001) as well as carotid-femoral PWV (13.99 ± 2.74, p < 0.01) and total cholesterol (6.97 ± 1.08, p < 0.001).
T3	Premise 1196 1498	Linear regression showed statistically significant associations between systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein, lip-line, and heart rate with c-IMT z-scores of >1.5SD in the fully adjusted models and the p values were 0.000, 0.000, 0.017, 0.001, and 0.044, respectively .
T4	Premise 1571 1792	In a full-model logistic regression, significant risk factors for an increase in IMT of ≥1.5 z-scores were carotid-femoral PWV (odds ratio: 1.119, confidence interval: 1.018, 1.230, p = 0.020 < 0.05) at first measurement.
T5	Claim 1793 1974	The conclusion of the study was that longitudinal c-IMT measurements revealed progression in subclinical atherosclerosis during a four-year period in a hypertensive old-aged cohort.
T6	Claim 1975 2108	Systolic or diastolic blood pressure, homocysteine, carotid-femoral PWV, and waistline were significantly related to c-IMT increment.
T7	MajorClaim 2109 2247	By lifestyle and medical intervention to control these risk factors may prevent progression of c-IMT in old-aged cohort with hypertension.
