T1	Premise 755 962	At the last follow-up visit, mean pre-operative IOP decreased from 31.1 (± 14.2) to 16.2 (± 1.5) mm Hg after trabeculectomy, and from 28.1 (± 9.0) to 15.7 (± 1.8) mm Hg after Ex-PRESS implantation (P=0.001).
T2	Premise 963 1161	The mean number of anti-glaucoma medicines prescribed at the last follow-up decreased from 3.7 pre-operatively (both groups) to 0.9 after trabeculectomy vs 0.3 after Ex-PRESS implantation (P=0.001).
T3	Premise 1162 1288	Complete success rates (5<IOP<18 mm Hg without medications) were higher with Ex-PRESS compared with trabeculectomy (P=0.0024).
T4	Premise 1289 1499	Postoperative complications were more frequent after trabeculectomy (33%) compared with Ex-PRESS (20%), with four trabeculectomy eyes (27%) needing postoperative interventions, compared with none with Ex-PRESS.
T5	Claim 1500 1570	Trabeculectomy and Ex-PRESS implantation provided similar IOP control,
T6	Claim 1575 1701	the Ex-PRESS group had a lower rate of complications, fewer postoperative interventions, and needed less glaucoma medications.
