Antiretroviral treatment (ART) interruptions increase the risk of severe morbidity/mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals from subSaharan Africa. We aimed to determine whether the risk is further increased among HIV-hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected patients in this setting. In this sub-analysis of a randomized-control trial, 632 participants from Côte d'Ivoire randomized to receive continuous-ART (C-ART), structured ART interruptions of 2-months off, 4-months on (2/4-ART), and CD4-guided ART interruptions (CD4GT, interruption at 350/mm3 and reintroduction at 250/mm3) were analyzed. Incidence rates (IR) of serious HIV- and non-HIV-related morbidity were compared between patients stratified on hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) status. Overall, 65 (10.3%) were HBsAg-positive, 29 (44.6%) of whom had HBV-DNA levels > 10,000 copies/mL. After a median 2.0 year (range = 0.2-3.1) follow-up, ≥ 1 serious HIV-related events occurred in 101 HIV mono-infected and 15 HIV-HBV co-infected patients (IR = 10.0 versus 13.2/100 person/years, respectively, P = 0.3), whereas the highest incidence was observed in co-infected patients with baseline HBV-replication > 10,000 copies/mL (IR = 24.0/100 person/years, P versus HIV mono-infected = 0.002). Incidence of bacterial infections was also highest in the co-infected group with HBV-replication > 10,000 copies/mL (IR = 12.9 versus 3.3/100 person/years in HIV mono-infected patients, P = 0.001). The relative effect of CD4GT or 2/4-ART versus C-ART was not different between infection groups (P for interaction = 0.4). No increase in the incidence of non-HIV-related morbidity was observed for co-infected patients (P = 0.5), even at HBV-replication levels > 10,000 copies/mL (P = 0.7). In conclusion, co-infected patients with elevated HBV-replication at ART-initiation are more susceptible to HIV-related morbidity, especially invasive bacterial diseases, during treatment interruption.
