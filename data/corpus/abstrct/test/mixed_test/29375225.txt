High blood pressure (BP) is a common chronic disease needs long life drug consumption to control. Spironolactone could be used as the fourth-line therapy in patients with resistant hypertension. However, there is no study to determine the effects of low dose spironolactone as a first line therapy in treatment of essential hypertension. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of low dose spironolactone monotherapy in management of essential hypertension. In this double blind randomized clinical trial, 40 patients who had stage I essential hypertension were randomly divided into two groups: intervention group received spironolactone 25 milligram once daily for one month and control group received placebo once daily. At the baseline and after one month, 24-hour BP holter-monitoring and serum potassium assay were done. Systolic BP was reduced from 143.5 ± 8.2 mmHg to 137.10 ± 7.57 mmHg in the intervention group, while it did not change significantly in control (between group treatment difference = -4.5 mmHg, p = 0.004). There was no significant reduction of diastolic BP in the intervention group in comparison to placebo group (between group treatment difference = -1.3 mmHg, p = 0.099). Short course monotherapy with low dose spironolactone is effective in reducing systolic BP in patients with stage I essential hypertension.
