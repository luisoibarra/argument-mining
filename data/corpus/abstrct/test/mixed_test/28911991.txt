To prospectively evaluate visual outcomes and complications during and after cataract surgery with or without prophylactic sclerostomy in nanophthalmic eyes with visually significant cataract.Sixty nanophthalmic eyes of 60 patients with visually significant cataract were randomly assigned to cataract surgery alone (control group, n = 31) or cataract surgery with concomitant prophylactic sclerostomy (sclerostomy group, n = 29). Surgery was performed using phacoemulsification or manual small-incision cataract surgery (SICS) based on the LOCS III grading score. Group differences in intraoperative and postoperative complications were analyzed and risk factors assessed. Fewer complications were noted in eyes receiving sclerostomy (5/29, 17.2%) as compared to control group eyes (12/31, 38.7%), though differences were marginally significant (P = .065). Four control group, but no sclerostomy group, eyes developed postoperative uveal effusions (P = .04). In multivariable models, sclerostomy decreased the odds of an intraoperative or postoperative complication by 80% (odds ratio [OR] = 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04-0.92, P = .039); SICS was associated with a significantly higher risk of complications as compared to phacoemulsification (OR = 5.95, 95% CI = 1.49-23.73, P = .012), while high preoperative intraocular pressure (OR = 4.54, 95% CI = 0.99-20.9, P = .052) and greater lens thickness (OR = 3.38, 95% CI = 0.88-12.91, P = .075) demonstrated a marginally significant association. Cataract surgery in eyes with nanophthalmos is associated with a high risk for vision-threatening complications. Performing a simultaneous prophylactic sclerostomy with cataract surgery reduces complication rates, particularly uveal effusions. Cataract surgery at earlier stages by phacoemulsification may be more beneficial than undergoing manual SICS.
