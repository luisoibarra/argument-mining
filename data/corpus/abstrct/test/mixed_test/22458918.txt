To evaluate the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy and safety of fixed-combination brimonidine 0.2%-timolol 0.5% compared with latanoprost 0.005% in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
This was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, investigator-masked clinical trial. After washout of any previous IOP-lowering medications, patients with IOP of 24 mmHg or higher were randomized to twice-daily fixed-combination brimonidine 0.2%-timolol 0.5% (n = 73) or once-daily latanoprost 0.005% (n = 75, dosed in the evening, with vehicle control in the morning to maintain masking) for 12 weeks. IOP was measured at 8 a.m. (before dosing), 10 a.m., and 3 p.m. at baseline, week 6, and week 12.
The primary efficacy endpoint was diurnal IOP (averaged over 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 3 p.m.) at week 12. Safety measures included biomicroscopy.
There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in mean diurnal IOP at baseline (p = 0.118). At week 12, the mean (SD) diurnal IOP was 17.8 (2.9) mmHg with brimonidine-timolol and 17.9 (3.9) mmHg with latanoprost (p = 0.794). The percentage of patients achieving at least a 20% decrease from baseline diurnal IOP at week 12 was 87.7% in the brimonidine-timolol group and 77.3% in the latanoprost group (p = 0.131). Measured biomicroscopic changes from baseline to week 12 were infrequent in both groups.
Fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol was as effective as latanoprost in reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Both treatments demonstrated favorable ocular tolerability. The duration of the study was 12 weeks, and additional studies will be needed to compare the efficacy and safety of fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol and latanoprost during long-term treatment.
