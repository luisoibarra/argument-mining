T1	Premise 809 1018	Compared with the spironolactone group (n=95), the clonidine group (n=92) presented similar rates of achieving the primary end point (20.5% versus 20.8%, respectively; relative risk, 1.01 [0.55-1.88]; P=1.00).
T2	Premise 1019 1197	Secondary end point analysis showed similar office BP (33.3% versus 29.3%) and ambulatory BP monitoring (44% versus 46.2%) control for spironolactone and clonidine, respectively.
T3	Premise 1207 1333	spironolactone promoted greater decrease in 24-h systolic and diastolic BP and diastolic daytime ambulatory BP than clonidine.
T4	Claim 1507 1635	clonidine was not superior to spironolactone in true resistant hypertensive patients, but the overall BP control was low (â‰ˆ21%).
T5	Claim 1710 1767	spironolactone is preferable for the fourth-drug therapy.
