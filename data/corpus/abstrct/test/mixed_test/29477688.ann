T1	Premise 762 967	The cumulative probability of failure during the first year of follow-up was 17.3% in the tube group and 7.9% in the trabeculectomy group (P = 0.01; hazard ratio, 2.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.60).
T2	Premise 1224 1362	Postoperative complications developed in 36 patients (29%) in the tube group and 48 patients (41%) in the trabeculectomy group (P = 0.06).
T3	Premise 1363 1558	Serious complications requiring reoperation or producing a loss of 2 Snellen lines or more occurred in 1 patient (1%) in the tube group and 8 patients (7%) in the trabeculectomy group (P = 0.03).
T4	Claim 1559 1678	Trabeculectomy with MMC had a higher surgical success rate than tube shunt implantation after 1 year in the PTVT Study.
T5	Claim 1840 1997	The frequency of serious complications producing vision loss or requiring reoperation was lower after tube shunt surgery relative to trabeculectomy with MMC.
T6	Claim 1679 1839	Lower IOP with use of fewer glaucoma medications was achieved after trabeculectomy with MMC compared with tube shunt surgery during the first year of follow-up.

T7	Premise 968 1223	Mean ± standard deviation IOP was 13.8±4.1 mmHg in the tube group and 12.4±4.4 mmHg in the trabeculectomy group at 1 year (P = 0.01), and the number of glaucoma medications was 2.1±1.4 in the tube group and 0.9±1.4 in the trabeculectomy group (P < 0.001).
