T1	Premise 820 950	Symptomatic hypotension did not develop in any of the patients during the wet session, compared to 4 (40%) during the dry session.
T2	Premise 951 1192	Systolic blood pressure adjusted to ultrafiltration was stable during the wet session, 0.22 mmHg/15 min (95% CI -0.27 to 0.70), P = 0.38, and significantly decreased during the dry session, -0.68 mmHg/15 min (95%CI -1.24 to -0.11), P = 0.02.
T3	Premise 1193 1253	Diastolic blood pressure did not change during the sessions.
T4	Premise 1254 1491	Mean atrial natriuretic peptide significantly increased in the wet session, by 31.36 pgr/mL (95%CI 8.73-53.99), P = 0.007, and slightly and insignificantly decreased in the dry session, by 21.66 pgr/mL (95% CI -52.59 to 9.25), P = 0.167.
T5	Claim 1533 1677	Reduced effective circulating volume is a major cause for IDH, which can be prevented using head-out water immersion facilitated redistribution.
T6	Premise 1492 1532	Aldosterone blood levels did not change.
