T1	Claim 2228 2313	It shows that a sequential combination of interferon-Î± and lamivudine was beneficial.
T2	Premise 1169 1356	Of the 46 patients in the treatment group, 73.91% had undetectable serum HBV DNA, 32.61% achieved HBeAg seroconversion and 21.74% lost hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at the endpoint.
T4	Premise 1357 1394	No LAM resistance emerged at week 96.
T5	Premise 1395 1585	In the control group, only one (4.35%) patient underwent spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion and had undetectable serum HBV DNA during observation, and moreover, none developed HBsAg clearance.
T6	Premise 1586 1644	For all patients, no serious adverse events were observed.
T7	Premise 1645 1903	Antiviral treatment with a sequential combination of IFN and LAM resulted in a significant improvement in the rates of undetectable serum HBV DNA, HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss in children with chronic HBV infection and immune-tolerant characteristics.
T8	MajorClaim 1994 2072	It remains unresolved how children with immune-tolerant CHB should be treated.
