T1	Claim 1343 1485	Trabeculectomy is more effective than phacoemulsification in reducing dependence on glaucoma drugs, but is associated with more complications.
T2	Claim 1215 1342	Both phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy are effective in reducing IOP in medically uncontrolled CACG eyes without cataract.
T3	Premise 1137 1214	Eight (33%) of 24 trabeculectomy eyes demonstrated cataract during follow-up.
T4	Premise 1013 1136	trabeculectomy was associated with significantly more surgical complications than phacoemulsification (46% vs 4%; P=0.001).
T5	Premise 869 1003	Over first 24 months, trabeculectomy-treated eyes required on average 1.1 fewer drugs than phacoemulsification-treated eyes (P<0.001).
T6	Premise 648 868	Phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy resulted in significant and comparable IOP reduction at 24 months after surgery (reduction of 8.4 mmHg or 34% for phacoemulsification vs 8.9 mmHg or 36% for trabeculectomy; P=0.76).
