T1	Claim 1377 1523	The technique of releasable sutures for trabeculectomy used in this study did not demonstrate significant advantages over standard trabeculectomy.
T2	Premise 1229 1375	There was no difference in the occurrence of shallow chamber, choroidal detachment, macular edema, additional surgery, or hyphema (P=0.56 to 1.0).
T3	Premise 1077 1177	The incidence of transient hypotony was higher in S group (20.4%) than the R group (9.1%) (P=0.046);
T4	Premise 1178 1228	hypotony recovered in 80.8% (21/26) within 1 week.
T5	Premise 757 1003	The IOP in the first week after trabeculectomy was significantly higher in the R group: day 1, 17.3 ± 8.6 versus 12.7 ± 6.0 mm Hg (P<0.001); day 3, 18.0 ± 7.3 versus 12.9 ± 6.3 mm Hg (P<0.001); day 7, 14.8 ± 6.3 versus 12.0 ± 4.9 mm Hg (P=0.001),
T6	Premise 1008 1076	no difference was observed after the second week (P=0.659 to 0.753).
T7	Claim 1524 1636	Releasable sutures were associated with some decrease in visual acuity and increase in postoperative complaints.
