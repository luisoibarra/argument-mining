Cardiovascular complications are one of main cause of increased mortality and morbidity among Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients. Altered metabolism of sulphur amino acids in diabetes reflected as increases in concentration of methionine and cysteine/cystine in the blood which known as a markers of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD). The aim of present study was to determine the effect of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) supplementation on sulfhydryl amino acids and Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) in patients with type 2 DM (T2DM). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 36 control and patients with DM. The subjects were randomly assigned to obtain 2 g/d EPA (n = 18) or placebo (n = 18) for 8 weeks. Fasting serum level of Cystein and Methionine were measured using HPLC method and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) as a proxy measure of atherosclerosis was computed. Eight weeks supplementation with EPA led to significant reductions in Met (p < 0.002) and Cys (p < 0.001) compared with the placebo (p < 0.06). In addition, compared to placebo a significant reduction in AIP were seen after taking EPA (p < 0.04). EPA supplementation in patients with T2DM for eight weeks had beneficial effects on Met, Cys and AIP, which may attribute to the prevention of vascular complications in the T2DM patients.
