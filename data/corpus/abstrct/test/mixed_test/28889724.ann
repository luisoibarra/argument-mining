T1	MajorClaim 1919 2120	The results highlight the need to promote the benefits of this drug combination in helping chronic hepatitis B patients with interferon resistance, and to promote its application in clinical practices.
T2	Premise 743 1100	After treatment, the levels of the indexes in both groups (the combination treatment group vs. the entecavir group) were as follows: bilirubin (67.5±7.7 vs. 82.4±13.5 μmol/L); International Normalized Ratio (INR) (1.21±0.8 vs. 1.14±0.7); creatinine (147.3±12.4 vs. 287.4±21.6 mg/dL); GGT (67.4±23.2 vs. 88.4±23.7 U/L); and ALT (63.4±40.8 vs. 96.5±23.5 U/L).
T3	Premise 1101 1358	In comparison of the indexes of hepatic fibrosis between the two groups, we found the following differences: PCIII (67.5±7.7 vs. 82.4±13.5 μg/L); IV-C (61.3±18.7 vs. 74.5±17.9 μg/L); HA (147.3±12.4 vs. 87.4±31.6 μg/L); and LN (88.7±13.2 vs 102.5±23.4 μg/L).
T4	Premise 1359 1499	The results showed that the differences in comparison of the indexes before and after the treatment were statistically significant (P<0.05).
T5	Premise 1500 1714	After treatment, the MELD score of patients in the combination treatment group was significantly lower than that in the entecavir group (18.7±3.2 vs. 22.5±3.4), with a statistically significant difference (P<0.05).
T6	Claim 1715 1918	In the chronic hepatitis B patients with interferon resistance, the combined administration of entecavir and adefovir dipivoxil can significantly improve liver function, hepatic fibrosis and MELD scores.
