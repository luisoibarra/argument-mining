T1	MajorClaim 41 244	valsartan/cilnidipine combination would suppress the home morning blood pressure (BP) surge (HMBPS) more effectively than a valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination in patients with morning hypertension
T2	Premise 968 1248	At the end of the treatment period, the changes in nocturnal SBP and morning SBP from baseline were significant in both the valsartan/cilnidipine and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide groups (P < .001): -5.0 vs -10.0 mm Hg (P = .035) and -10.7 vs -13.6 mm Hg (P = .142), respectively.
T3	Premise 1249 1438	HMBPS was significantly decreased from baseline in both groups (P < .001), but there was no significant difference between the two groups: 14.4 mm Hg vs 14.0 mm Hg, respectively (P = .892).
T5	Claim 1439 1544	Valsartan/cilnidipine could not significantly suppress HMBPS compared with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide.
