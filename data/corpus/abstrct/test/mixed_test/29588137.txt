Low serum vitamin D has been associated with metabolic syndrome and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study aimed to investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementation in treatment of patients with NAFLD. In a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial patients with NAFLD were randomized to receive one weekly pearl of placebo, 50,000 U vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) pearl per week and 0.25 mg calcitriol (1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol) pearl per day for 3 months. 106 NAFLD patients were randomized to receive calcitriol, vitamin D3 and placebo pearls for 12 weeks and data for 91 patients were analyzed. After 12 weeks of treatment, serum alkaline phosphatase levels was significantly decreased from baseline levels in vitamin D and calcitriol treated groups (P < 0.05). Serum and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) level was also significantly decreased compared to the baseline levels after 12 weeks of treatment with vitamin D. There was no statistically significant difference between placebo, calcitriol, vitamin D groups in terms of serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, serum GGT and lipid profile (P > 0.05). While significant reduction of serum alkaline phosphatase and GGT were seen with vitamin D and calcitriol supplementation from baseline levels, no beneficial effects was seen when comparing vitamin D, calcitriol and placebo groups at the end of trial.
