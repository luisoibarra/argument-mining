T1	Premise 928 1242	Compared with metformin, COC plus spironolactone caused larger decreases in hirsutism score (mean difference 4.6 points, 95% CI: 2.6-6.7), total testosterone (1.1 nmol/L, 0.4-1.7), free testosterone (25 pmol/L, 12-39), androstenedione (5.5 nmol/L, 1.8-9.2) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (2.7 μmol/L, 1.4-4.0).
