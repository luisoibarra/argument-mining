T1	Claim 1522 1581	Both treatments demonstrated favorable ocular tolerability.
T2	Claim 1386 1521	Fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol was as effective as latanoprost in reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
T3	Premise 1108 1296	The percentage of patients achieving at least a 20% decrease from baseline diurnal IOP at week 12 was 87.7% in the brimonidine-timolol group and 77.3% in the latanoprost group (p = 0.131).
T4	Premise 975 1107	At week 12, the mean (SD) diurnal IOP was 17.8 (2.9) mmHg with brimonidine-timolol and 17.9 (3.9) mmHg with latanoprost (p = 0.794).
T5	Premise 1297 1385	Measured biomicroscopic changes from baseline to week 12 were infrequent in both groups.
