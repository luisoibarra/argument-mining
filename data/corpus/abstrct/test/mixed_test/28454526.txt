The aim of this work is to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of preservative containing 0.0015% tafluprost and preservative-free 0.0015% tafluprost using a prospective crossover study. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and normotensive glaucoma (NTG) patients were randomized enrolled. Group 1 ("NPT to PT") patients used preservative-free 0.0015% tafluprost (NPT) for 6 months and then changed to preservative containing 0.0015% tafluprost(PT) for 6 months. Group 2 ("PT to NPT") patients used preservative containing 0.0015% tafluprost for 6 months and changed to preservative-free 0.0015% tafluprost for 6 months. At 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 12 months, we measured intraocular pressure for efficacy and graded corneal erosion, tear break-up time (TBUT), and subjective discomfort. A total of 20 patients and 20 eyes were enrolled. In Group 1 and 2, intraocular pressure was well controlled to approximately 14 mmHg (9.38-18.46% decrease). Generally, subjective satisfaction was improved after changing from PT to NPT (p = 0.03) and TBUT using PT was numerically inferior to that using NPT (p = 0.06) but not when changing from NPT to PT. Both preservative containing and preservative-free 0.0015% tafluprost reduced intraocular pressure significantly. In addition, changing medication from PT to NPT might improve subjective satisfaction and tear break up time.
