T1	Claim 1273 1333	Both drops provided effective IOP reduction that was greater
T2	Claim 1338 1423	patients were more likely to achieve lower target pressures with BTFC than with TTFC.
T3	Premise 653 752	Both drops provided statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline at all visits (P<0.001).
T4	Premise 753 855	BTFC provided greater significant mean IOP reductions from baseline than TTFC at each visit (P<0.001).
T5	Premise 856 1002	Mean IOP reductions were 11.34 and 6.42 mm Hg at 2 weeks (P=0.000), and 11.17 and 7.89 mmHg at 6 months (P=0.001) for BTFC and TTFC, respectively.
T6	Premise 1003 1272	IOPs at 2 weeks were 18 mm Hg in 36 (90.8%) versus 22 (55%) eyes and 16 mm Hg in 28 (70%) versus 16 (40%) eyes (P<0.001), and at 6 months, 18 mm Hg in 38 (95%) versus 28 (70%) eyes and 16 mm Hg in 30 (75%) versus 18 (45%) eyes for BTFC and TTFC, respectively (P<0.001).
