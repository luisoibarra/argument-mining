The authors tested the hypothesis that a valsartan/cilnidipine combination would suppress the home morning blood pressure (BP) surge (HMBPS) more effectively than a valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination in patients with morning hypertension, defined as systolic BP (SBP) ≥135 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥85 mm Hg assessed by a self-measuring information and communication technology-based home BP monitoring device more than three times before either combination's administration. This was an 8-week prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial. The HMBPS, which is a new index, was defined as the mean morning SBP minus the mean nocturnal SBP, both measured on the same day. The authors randomly allocated 129 patients to the valsartan/cilnidipine (63 patients; mean 68.4 years) or valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (66 patients; mean 67.3 years) combination groups, and the baseline HMBPS values were 17.4 mm Hg vs 16.9 mm Hg, respectively (P = .820). At the end of the treatment period, the changes in nocturnal SBP and morning SBP from baseline were significant in both the valsartan/cilnidipine and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide groups (P < .001): -5.0 vs -10.0 mm Hg (P = .035) and -10.7 vs -13.6 mm Hg (P = .142), respectively. HMBPS was significantly decreased from baseline in both groups (P < .001), but there was no significant difference between the two groups: 14.4 mm Hg vs 14.0 mm Hg, respectively (P = .892). Valsartan/cilnidipine could not significantly suppress HMBPS compared with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide. Large-scale randomized controlled studies are needed to assess how reducing HMBPS will affect future cardiovascular outcomes. The information and communication technology-based home BP monitoring device may become an alternative to ambulatory BP monitoring, which has been a gold standard to measure nocturnal BP and the morning BP surge.
