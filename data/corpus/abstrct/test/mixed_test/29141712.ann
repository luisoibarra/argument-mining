T1	Claim 1767 1968	In conclusion, co-infected patients with elevated HBV-replication at ART-initiation are more susceptible to HIV-related morbidity, especially invasive bacterial diseases, during treatment interruption.
T2	Premise 1599 1766	No increase in the incidence of non-HIV-related morbidity was observed for co-infected patients (P = 0.5), even at HBV-replication levels > 10,000 copies/mL (P = 0.7).
T3	Premise 1476 1598	The relative effect of CD4GT or 2/4-ART versus C-ART was not different between infection groups (P for interaction = 0.4).
T4	Premise 1278 1475	Incidence of bacterial infections was also highest in the co-infected group with HBV-replication > 10,000 copies/mL (IR = 12.9 versus 3.3/100 person/years in HIV mono-infected patients, P = 0.001).
T5	Premise 877 1094	After a median 2.0 year (range = 0.2-3.1) follow-up, â‰¥ 1 serious HIV-related events occurred in 101 HIV mono-infected and 15 HIV-HBV co-infected patients (IR = 10.0 versus 13.2/100 person/years, respectively, P = 0.3)
