T1	Premise 674 857	Fewer complications were noted in eyes receiving sclerostomy (5/29, 17.2%) as compared to control group eyes (12/31, 38.7%), though differences were marginally significant (P = .065).
T2	Premise 858 959	Four control group, but no sclerostomy group, eyes developed postoperative uveal effusions (P = .04).
T3	Premise 960 1150	In multivariable models, sclerostomy decreased the odds of an intraoperative or postoperative complication by 80% (odds ratio [OR] = 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04-0.92, P = .039);
T4	Premise 1151 1507	SICS was associated with a significantly higher risk of complications as compared to phacoemulsification (OR = 5.95, 95% CI = 1.49-23.73, P = .012), while high preoperative intraocular pressure (OR = 4.54, 95% CI = 0.99-20.9, P = .052) and greater lens thickness (OR = 3.38, 95% CI = 0.88-12.91, P = .075) demonstrated a marginally significant association.
T5	Claim 1508 1620	Cataract surgery in eyes with nanophthalmos is associated with a high risk for vision-threatening complications.
T6	Claim 1621 1751	Performing a simultaneous prophylactic sclerostomy with cataract surgery reduces complication rates, particularly uveal effusions.
T7	MajorClaim 1752 1861	Cataract surgery at earlier stages by phacoemulsification may be more beneficial than undergoing manual SICS.
