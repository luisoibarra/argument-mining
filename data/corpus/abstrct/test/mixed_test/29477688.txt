To report 1-year treatment outcomes in the Primary Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (PTVT) Study. Two hundred forty-two eyes of 242 patients with medically uncontrolled glaucoma and no previous incisional ocular surgery, including 125 in the tube group and 117 in the trabeculectomy group. Patients were enrolled at 16 clinical centers and assigned randomly to treatment with a tube shunt (350-mm2 Baerveldt glaucoma implant) or trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC; 0.4 mg/ml for 2 minutes). Intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucoma medical therapy, visual acuity, visual fields, surgical complications, and failure (IOP of more than 21 mmHg or reduced by less than 20% from baseline, IOP of 5 mmHg or less, reoperation for glaucoma, or loss of light perception vision). The cumulative probability of failure during the first year of follow-up was 17.3% in the tube group and 7.9% in the trabeculectomy group (P = 0.01; hazard ratio, 2.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.60). Mean ± standard deviation IOP was 13.8±4.1 mmHg in the tube group and 12.4±4.4 mmHg in the trabeculectomy group at 1 year (P = 0.01), and the number of glaucoma medications was 2.1±1.4 in the tube group and 0.9±1.4 in the trabeculectomy group (P < 0.001). Postoperative complications developed in 36 patients (29%) in the tube group and 48 patients (41%) in the trabeculectomy group (P = 0.06). Serious complications requiring reoperation or producing a loss of 2 Snellen lines or more occurred in 1 patient (1%) in the tube group and 8 patients (7%) in the trabeculectomy group (P = 0.03). Trabeculectomy with MMC had a higher surgical success rate than tube shunt implantation after 1 year in the PTVT Study. Lower IOP with use of fewer glaucoma medications was achieved after trabeculectomy with MMC compared with tube shunt surgery during the first year of follow-up. The frequency of serious complications producing vision loss or requiring reoperation was lower after tube shunt surgery relative to trabeculectomy with MMC.
