To compare blood pressure and urine albumin-creatinine ratio over time for participants receiving aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab. Preplanned secondary analyses from a randomized trial comparing aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab for diabetic macular edema (DME). The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) enrolled 660 participants with DME and visual acuity 20/32 or worse in at least one eye. Eyes received intravitreous injections of 2.0 mg aflibercept, 1.25 mg bevacizumab, or 0.3 mg ranibizumab based on a structured retreatment protocol over 2 years. Main outcome measures were (1) a change in blood pressure at 2 years, and (2) a change in urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) at 1 year. At baseline, 95 participants (14%) had normal blood pressure, 220 (33%) had borderline blood pressure elevation, 206 (31%) had mild blood pressure elevation, and 139 (21%) had moderate blood pressure elevation. Average change in mean arterial pressure from baseline to 2 years was -1.2 ± 15, -1.8 ± 13.5, -2.6 ± 14.4 mm Hg in the aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab groups, respectively (global P = 0.69). At baseline 247 participants (38%) had no albuminuria (<30 mg/g), 195 (30%) had microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/g), and 212 (32%) had macroalbuminuria (>300 mg/g). Changes in UACR category were not different among treatment groups at the 52-week visit (global P = 0.29). There do not appear to be treatment group differences for changes in blood pressure or UACR as a reflection of kidney function in patients with DME treated with aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab.
