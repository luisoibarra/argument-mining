T1	Premise 1239 1333	Risk of all three outcomes was higher for participants with chronic kidney disease or frailty.
T2	Premise 1334 1492	Older age was also associated with greater risk of syncope, hypotension, and falls, but there was no age-by-treatment interaction for any of the SAE outcomes.
T3	Claim 1493 1610	Participants randomized to intensive SBP control had greater risk of hypotension and possibly syncope, but not falls.
T4	Premise 936 1238	Randomization to intensive SBP control was associated with greater risk of an SAE involving hypotension (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21-2.32, P = .002), and possibly syncope (HR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.98-1.79, P = .07), but not falls (HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.75-1.29, P = .90).
