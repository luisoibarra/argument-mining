T2	Claim 1672 1875	This study suggests that a short-term replacement diet with ancient KAMUT khorasan products is most effective in reducing metabolic risk factors and ameliorating the liver profile in patients with NAFLD.
T3	Premise 1464 1671	significant improvements in the liver steatosis grading, Doppler perfusion index values, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were evident after consumption of both the khorasan and control products.
T4	Premise 1178 1454	significant reductions in circulating proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha by 50%, interleukin l-receptor antagonist-alpha by 37%, interleukin-8 by 24%, and interferon gamma by 24% were evident only in participants who consumed the khorasan products (p < 0.05 for all).
T5	Premise 808 1166	After the implementation of a general linear model for repeated measurements adjusted for baseline demographic details, risk factors, and medication, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was significantly reduced by 12%, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) by 14%, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) by 8%, and cholesterol by 6% only in the khorasan group (p < 0.05 for all).
