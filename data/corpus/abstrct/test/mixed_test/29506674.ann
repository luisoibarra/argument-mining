T1	Claim 1457 1562	Larger sample size is presumably needed to assess the effect of RIPC for patients with diabetes mellitus.
T2	Claim 1325 1456	Remote ischemic preconditioning significantly reduces the incidence of acute kidney injury in non-diabetic patients undergoing PCI.
T3	Premise 941 1164	RIPC significantly reduced CIN incidence in the overall population (12.1% vs. 26.1%, p=0.01, with a NNT=9) and in non-diabetic patients (9.2% vs. 25.0%, p=0.02), but showed no benefit in diabetics (16.7% vs. 28.2%, p=0.21).
T4	Premise 1165 1324	A trend for lower PMI was seen in the intervention arm (creatine kinase - muscle brain >5 URL; 8.4% vs. 16.4%, p=0.07; troponin T >5 URL; 27% vs. 38%, p=0.21).
