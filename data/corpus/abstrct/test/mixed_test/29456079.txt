Efficacy of sequential therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues and interferons versus monotherapy in patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains unexplored. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of sequential therapy with adefovir (ADV) or entecavir (ETV) followed by peginterferon (PEG-IFN) alfa-2a in Taiwanese patients with HBeAg-positive. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted at nine sites in Taiwan from April 2010 to October 2013. Patients (N = 280) were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, ETV or ADV alone for four weeks, combined with PEG-IFN alfa-2a for two weeks, then PEG-IFN alfa-2a alone for 46 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was HBeAg seroconversion at 48 weeks post-treatment. No significant differences were observed among groups for HBeAg seroconversion (PEG-IFN alfa-2a+placebo, 36.3%; PEG-IFN alfa-2a+ETV, 29.5%; and PEG-IFN alfa-2a+ADV, 27.4%), HBeAg loss (37.4%, 32.2%, and 28.6%, respectively) or change in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels from baseline (-0.56 IU/mL, -0.60 IU/mL, and -0.41 IU/mL, respectively). However, hepatitis B virus DNA levels were higher with PEG-IFN alfa-2a+placebo than PEG-IFN alfa+ETV at week 64 (p = 0.0412), 76 (p = 0.0311), and 88 (p = 0.0113), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization rate was higher with PEG-IFN alfa-2a+placebo than PEG-IFN alfa-2a+ADV (p = 0.0283) or PEG-IFN alfa-2a+ETV (p = 0.0369) at week 88. Sub-analysis of results revealed an association between on-treatment HBsAg and ALT levels and efficacy 48 weeks post-treatment. Safety was comparable among treatment groups. Pre-therapy with ADV or ETV followed by PEG-IFN alfa-2a is not superior to PEG-IFN alfa-2a monotherapy in Taiwanese patients with HBeAg-positive CHB.
