T1	Premise 1055 1262	Aortic systolic pressure and augmentation index, assessed by radial artery oscillatory tonometry, were unaffected by CPAP but decreased after AZT and AZT plus CPAP (RM-ANOVA P = .030 and .031, respectively).
T2	Premise 1263 1397	The apnea-hypopnea index was significantly reduced in all three treatment arms, most prominently by AZT plus CPAP (RM-ANOVA P = .003).
T3	Premise 1398 1538	The reduction of venous bicarbonate concentration following AZT was correlated with the change of apnea-hypopnea index (r = 0.66, P = .013).
T4	Claim 1539 1665	AZT reduced blood pressure, vascular stiffness, and sleep-disordered breathing in patients with OSA and comorbid hypertension.
T5	MajorClaim 1666 1802	Carbonic anhydrase inhibition may constitute a potential target for drug therapy in patients with sleep apnea and comorbid hypertension.
