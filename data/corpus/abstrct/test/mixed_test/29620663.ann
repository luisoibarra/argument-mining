T1	Premise 688 916	At the end of the study, the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the ISH LSSalt group had significantly decreased by 10.18 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.13 to 17.2, P = .006) compared with that of the ISH NSalt group,
T2	Premise 923 1067	the mean SBP only decreased by 5.10 mm Hg (95% CI: -2.02 to 12.2, P = .158) in the NISH LSSalt group compared with that of the NISH NSalt group.
T3	Premise 1068 1166	The mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) had no significant differences in the ISH and NISH groups.
T4	Premise 1167 1250	No obvious renin angiotensin system activation was found after LSSalt intervention.
T5	Claim 1410 1521	The present study showed that the SBP of ISH patients was significantly decreased with the LSSalt intervention,
T6	Claim 1528 1693	neither the SBP of the NISH patients nor the DBP of either group were similarly decreased, which indicated that ISH patients were more sensitive to salt restriction.
T7	Premise 1251 1409	Regarding the urinary excretion of electrolytes and blood biochemical assays, the LSSalt treatment had the same effects on the ISH group as on the NISH group.
T8	MajorClaim 0 128	Evidence has shown that long-term sodium reduction can not only reduce blood pressure, but also provide cardiovascular benefits.
