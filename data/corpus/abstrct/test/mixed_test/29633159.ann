T1	Claim 9 91	anthracyclines are effective chemotherapeutic agents for treating B-cell lymphoma,
T2	Claim 92 194	adverse effects, such as bone marrow suppression and cardiotoxicity, limit their clinical application.
T3	Premise 980 1258	Cumulative anthracycline doses of 253-400 mg (HR: 2.35; 95% CI 1.41-3.91; p = 0.0010), 401-504 mg (HR: 2.26; 95% CI 1.26-4.05; p = 0.0063), and > 504 mg (HR: 2.29; 95% CI 1.25-4.18; p = 0.0072) increased the incidence density of diabetes in a dose-dependent manner (p = 0.0006).
T4	Premise 771 979	Anthracycline administration was associated with a higher incidence of diabetes (HR: 1.75; 95% CI 1.11-2.75; p = 0.0163) after adjustments for age, gender, cumulative dose of prednisolone, and co-morbidities.
T5	Premise 1259 1454	The annual alteration of adapted diabetes complications severity index score was not significantly different between B-cell lymphoma patients with or without anthracycline treatment (p = 0.4924).

T7	Claim 1557 1689	Intensive blood glucose monitoring and control should be recommended for B-cell lymphoma patients receiving anthracycline treatment.
