T1	Premise 550 745	The overall response rate was 8.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]) 3.2% to 13.7% for patients treated with PVI 5-FU alone compared with 17.6%; 95% CI 10.3% to 25.1% for PVI 5-FU plus MMC (P =.04).
T2	Premise 746 849	Median failure-free survival was 2.8 months for PVI 5-FU and 3.8 months for PVI 5-FU plus MMC (P =.14).
T3	Premise 850 940	Median survival was 5.1 months for PVI 5-FU and 6.5 months for PVI 5-FU plus MMC (P =.34).
T4	Premise 941 975	Toxicities in both arms were mild.
T5	Premise 976 1106	There was an increased incidence of neutropenia in the 5-FU plus MMC arm (P <.01), although no differences in infection were seen.
T6	Premise 1107 1155	No patients developed hemolytic uremic syndrome.
T7	Claim 1156 1278	Global QOL improved significantly after 24 weeks of treatment compared with baseline for patients receiving 5-FU plus MMC,
T8	Premise 1279 1358	although there was no statistically significant difference in QOL between arms.
T9	Claim 1533 1675	These results emphasize the importance of chemotherapy in this setting and the continuing value of the fluoropyrimidines in pancreatic cancer.
T10	Claim 1359 1478	PVI 5-FU plus MMC resulted in a superior response rate in comparison with PVI 5-FU alone in advanced pancreatic cancer,
T11	Claim 1479 1532	but this did not translate into a survival advantage.
