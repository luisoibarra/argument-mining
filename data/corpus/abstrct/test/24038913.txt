 We analyzed the long-term survival of children under 6 years of age (<6 years) enrolled upon the Children's Cancer Group (CCG)-945 high-grade glioma (HGG) study to determine the impact of intrinsic biological characteristics as well as treatment upon both survival and quality of life (QOL) in this younger age population. Analyses were undertaken on patients <6 years with institutionally diagnosed HGG enrolled on the CCG-945 trial. Comparisons of survival were performed for patients <3 years of age (<3 years) (treated with intent to avoid irradiation) versus those between 3 and 6 years of age (3-6 years) (treated with irradiation and chemotherapy) at diagnosis. Discordance between the institutional diagnoses of HGG and consensus-reviewed diagnoses led us to perform further survival analyses for both groups. We compared the two groups of patients for biological markers, and evaluated the neuropsychological and QOL outcomes of long-term survivors. Patients <3 years (n = 49, 19.5% of all enrolled patients) at diagnosis had a 10-year EFS and OS of 29 ± 6.5% and 37.5 ± 7%, respectively, while for patients 3-6 years (n = 34, 13.5% of all enrolled patients) 10-year EFS and OS were 35 ± 8% and 36 ± 8%, respectively. Molecular marker analysis showed that a smaller proportion of patients <3 years harbored TP53 mutations (P = 0.05). Analysis of QOL outcomes with a median length of follow-up of 15.1 years (9.5-19.2) showed comparable results. QOL and survival data were similar for the two groups. A larger prospective study is justified to study the efficacy of chemotherapy only regimens in younger children.
