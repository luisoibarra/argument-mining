T1	Premise 533 701	Patients treated with DC had a median survival of 11.3 v 10.1 months for VC-treated patients (P =.044; hazard ratio, 1.183 [97.2% confidence interval, 0.989 to 1.416]).
T2	Premise 702 791	The 2-year survival rate was 21% for DC-treated patients and 14% for VC-treated patients.
T3	Premise 792 890	Overall response rate was 31.6% for DC-treated patients v 24.5% for VC-treated patients (P =.029).
T4	Premise 891 1075	Median survival (9.4 v 9.9 months [for VC]; P =.657; hazard ratio, 1.048 [97.2 confidence interval, 0.877 to 1.253]) and response (23.9%) with DCb were similar to those results for VC.
T5	Premise 1076 1179	Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infection, and febrile neutropenia were similar with all three regimens.
T6	Premise 1180 1276	Grade 3 to 4 anemia, nausea, and vomiting were more common (P <.01) with VC than with DC or DCb.
T7	Premise 1277 1426	Patients treated with either docetaxel regimen had consistently improved QoL compared with VC-treated patients, who experienced deterioration in QoL.
T8	Claim 1427 1502	DC resulted in a more favorable overall response and survival rate than VC.
T9	Claim 1503 1611	Both DC and DCb were better tolerated and provided patients with consistently improved QoL compared with VC.
T10	Claim 1612 1807	These findings demonstrate that a docetaxel plus platinum combination is an effective treatment option with a favorable therapeutic index for first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
