T1	Premise 945 1084	Over 73 months after randomization, the fludarabine group gained a mean of 45 days of toxicity-free survival at CAP, and 61 days over ChOP.
T2	Premise 1085 1183	The mean TWIST was 27.05 months with CAP, 31.5 months with ChOP and 32.95 months with fludarabine.
T3	Premise 1184 1330	The threshold analyses showed that, whatever the utility weights, the mean Q-TWIST was always greater with ChOP or fludarabine as compared to CAP.
T4	Claim 1331 1389	Fludarabine was consistently a better treatment than ChOP,
T5	Premise 1390 1513	except in the unlikely case of high utility weights attributed to toxicity and low utility weights attributed to treatment.
T6	Premise 1528 1672	from a clinical point of view, differences between ChOP and fludarabine were moderate or event slight (mean difference in TWIST of 1.45 months).
T7	Claim 1690 1801	patients with advanced CLL have a moderate benefit in terms of Q-TWIST when treated with fludarabine over ChOP.
T8	Claim 1802 1850	These two treatments are always superior to CAP.
