I work at a private university and we do not sue for collections. Since the debt can be reported to the credit bureau for 7 years, we like to keep our accounts at collection agencies during that entire time. With the language now being offered due to time-barred states, our collection agencies do not want any of our accounts older than 4 years (TX).
