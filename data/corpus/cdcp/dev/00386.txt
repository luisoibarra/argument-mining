As a Director for Collections now for Kennedy Space Center Federal Credit Union, which is over 500 Million in asset size I try as I have for prior union to file suit closest to the Consumers current address. One method is to assign over to an attorney within the current residence-venue of the Consumer. In legal terms we attempt to get service when filing a suit out of state, its method is called obtaining if possible a Alien Juddgement outside from the County and or State the contract/note was originally signed. There are states in the Union that do note accept foreighn judgments. So recording a judgement obtained for example in Floirda and rerecorded in another State may not be possible.
