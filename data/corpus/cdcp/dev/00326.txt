banks can simply add this provision to their Loan Sale Agreements. All buyers executing a Loan Sale Agreement containing such a provision would be contractually obligated to refrain from litigating or threatening litigation. some current buyer would refuse to purchase with such a provision and other current buyers would expect a price discount because they woudl not be able to sue. In both instances, any inventory not acquired by current buyers would be quicly snapped up by other purchasors who would be willing to comply with these contractual provisions. Such a resolution would obviate the necessity of legislation or regulation as the matter woudl have been taken care of under the contract between a willing seller and a willing buyer. there would be no constitutional question regarding the restricting of law suits  nor would there be any delay in implementation. All that would be required is the cooperation of the selling banks which could be induced readily with some Safe-Harbor language for banks that follow this protocol.
