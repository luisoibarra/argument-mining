I would suggest a visit to the Federal Bankruptcy Rule 3001(effective 12/1/2012) and comments made during the proposed period, plus the hearing presentation statements published and are available. The Rule already addresses documentation issues. I again see that attaching all of the proposed documentation to the validation notice is not productive for the consumer or the sender. I do believe additional documentation as to chain of title be available if a consumer is being sued in Court.
