I do not believe that it is "just" to allow a third party to buy a past due debt and sue for the entire balance, plus attorney fees, court costs, and other fees associated with "mediators or arbitrators". I believe that a third party debt buyer should be limited as to how much they can sue for above their initial investment. Too many times the original creditor is a publically traded company  and the loss has already been taken by the share holders. Then some debt buyer buys a portfolio of un-performing debt and pays a dime on a dollar for it. Sends all of it to a "law office" to collect 100% or more of the original alleged obligation. The debt buyer should not be able to sue for 900% of their investment. They should be limited to a percentage of true damage. I know of no other civil process where this would be considered ethical.
