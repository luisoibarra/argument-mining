Assuming debtors have a valid address, which is some cases they do not, additional notice that the debt is being assigned to a third party collection entity is no benefit.My experience is intervention to collect by a third party normally occurs when the consumer is over 180 contractual delinquent.Furthermore, if the consumer receives the warning the account would be placed with a third partyMany and more confusing to the consumer and agency.
