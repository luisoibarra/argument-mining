There needs to be something in place to stop the frivilous law suits that agencies have to spend thousands of dollars to defend even though they have tried to explain to the consumers / attorneys that there was no wrong doing and no case a lot of these consumers file the suits Pro Se and continue pushing for a settlement or trial in these cases the agencies spend monies to prove there was no cause for action to begin with and to have a judge agree with the agency.
