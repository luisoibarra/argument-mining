A separate "summary of rights" should be sent to, and made available, to consumers. We are woefully uninformed and misinformed about our rights as consumers; what avenues of negotiation we can pursue; or even who can assist us. Furthermore, there should be some laws on the books on when collectors cannot collect if the original creditor has not made an attempt to collect the debt for an extended period of time, I should not get a collection notice 20 years after the fact.
