A debt collector did not litigate a credit card debt, but summarily garnished our joint checking account. It was two weeks later that notification was received from the debt collector. This occurred September-October 2012. Debt Collectors must provide advance notice of their intent to garnish a checking account. It took several weeks including an Order from the Judge to release the funds, only after the Debt Collector took all of a tax refund.
