If I have been falsely served or subserved, (the making up of a person who does not exist to claim a service, or simply stating "Jane Doe" received the service) and the judges don't care, and the debt collection companies don't care, I should have the right to file an errors and omissions insurance claim against the debt collection company for false service that resulted in a verdict against me. I have already tried asking for an errors and omissions insurance policy from the debt collection company  so that I could file a claim and the debt collection company simply ignored my request. I find this both egregious and outrageous.
