In most states all that a debt collection law office needs to provide is a complaint. The average consumer has no idea what the difference is between a balance and a sum. they do not know how to calculate the interest and certainly do not know what is "legal" pursuant to state or Federal Credit Card Act limitations. The name of the Plaintiff may not even be recognizable to them. They just know that they owed some money and fell behind on bills. More times than not, they do not respond at all.
