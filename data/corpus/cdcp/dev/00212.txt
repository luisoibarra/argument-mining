I do NOT owe any debt but have a COMMON FIRST and LAST NAME. My Constitutional rights are violated every time a lawyer fails to perform due diligence, per rule 137, BEFORE SIGNING and FILING COURT PAPER against me. The clerks are helpless,  the judges & attorney disciplinary do nothing favoring "lawyer zealousness." I then have to spend time & money, going to court to prove I am NOT the person who owes the debt. I urge the CFPB to create mechanisms for clerks & citizens that make it 1) easier to fix these messes &, 2) to bring sanctions against lawyers & judges for MISUSE OF LEGAL PROCEDURE, ABUSE OF PROCESS, WRONGFUL CIVIL PROCEEDINGS, & MALICIOUS PROSECUTION.
