I have a common last name, and for about three years I was bombarded with collection calls for other individuals with my last name and first initial.I finally changed my phone listing from my initials to my nickname and have had only collection call since.I am an elderly retiree.I have no car loan or mortgage.I pay all my bills on time, and I don't carry balances on my credit cards.No debt collector has ever admitted to me that they got my number out of the phone but, but that's what they're doing.I would like to see every debt collector tell the individual they are calling the source of their information.I now have a long list of people with debts in collection.Since I'm not a debt collector,I don't believe that I have a legal obligation not to reveal their names.I do, however, believe that I have a moral obligation not to do so.Please find a way to keep debt collectors from harassing innocent people.
