In many districts where bad check diversion programs exist, there is anecdotal evidence that the companies administering the programs threaten with prosecution individuals who do not come within the state's bad check law for example, checks that bounce due to printing errors, checks for which there were funds available when written but not when presented, and individuals who pay the amount due by other means within grace periods permitted by state law. The CFPB should ensure that bad check diversion programs have a realistic means of ensuring that only individuals realistically subject to prosecution are targeted, and should also require that, in order to qualify for the 1692p safe harbor, diversion programs prohibit misleading communications and misstatements of state bad check law.
