Allow the States and/or local courts administer lawsuits. Regardless of any added rules, documents, etc. none will help increase debtors attending hearings. Since 1964 I have seen no significant increase of consumers attending hearings. I have, however, seen the major reason being attributed to not understanding due process by consumers.
