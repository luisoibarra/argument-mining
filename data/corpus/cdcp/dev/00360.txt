Just like mortgage servicers are required to send "goodbye letters" (a notification of when loan has been sold) and "hello letters" (a notification of when another company is buying a debt), so also should debt collectors. Also, they should be required to disclose the amount for which they bought the debt... the discounted price. Also, there needs to be full disclosure as to who is buying the debt along with the disclosure of the owners of the debt collection company and the street address of the company so face-to-face meetings can be arranged. Full transparency and full disclosure should be required related to any company trying to collect debt.
