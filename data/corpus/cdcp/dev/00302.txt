I would suggest a review of the language already published in the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy BR 3001( effective date 12/1/2012) relating to documentation. Based upon my participation with the Rule and numerous comments/hearings, I believe some time can be eliminated without re-inventing a different set of standards. Bankruptcy involves collection and involves consumers including attorneys on both sides as well. I recommend another examination of the "validation" notice language and the litany of interpretations of the language.
