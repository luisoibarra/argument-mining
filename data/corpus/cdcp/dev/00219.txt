Maybe I missed something but I never received any notice from my original mortgage lender that my mortgage was sold. Maybe that is better since the new "owner" may be a pool of investors. my experience was the buyer sent the notice listing the original creditor name. Requiring the seller and buyer to send a notice would cause consumer confusion.
