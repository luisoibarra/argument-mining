The agency needs to be careful of new rules that will, though unintended, be harmful to the free market. However, it is important that litigation is monitored to ensure that the system does not allow reward with no risk. A plaintiff in a lawsuit cannot be placed in a situation where it is rewarding to sue with insufficient cause and minimal risk. Creditors and those following in the process of recovery do not need additional regulation in this area since their efforts are monitored by the CFPB. The CFPB does not need to set standards for the industry, but make it clear that only those documents provided to the court in the original filing will be considered in a CFPB review. If in the course of a CFPB review, it is found that litigation was filed without a successful verification of the facts, the CFPB could award the amount sought by the filing to the defendant of the case and a fine to the CFPB of no less than $2,000 but no more than the amount sought. This position would motivate the litigant to ensure their facts were correct before any filing took place. This position would allow CFPB to review cases filed no matter how they were adjudicated by the involved court. This review could be conducted at CFPB offices since it only requires the original filings. This review could be initiated simply based on a complaint to the agency's offices. The penalty could be adjustable based on a variety of agency standards. I would have to take more time to consider when the plaintiff was not the original creditor or a member of the recovery industry, but, again, there must be a risk associated with the reward to stop nuisance suits.
