FDCPA should define what constitutes reasonable period of time. In my experience most attorneys who represent a debtor do not return communication inquiries about representation. In most cases the delay in response may be caused by the debtor paying installment payments to the attorney to file a bankruptcy proceeding. When the debtor does not keep the repayment terms a creditor is presently not notified that the representation has terminated  and there is no attorney representation.
