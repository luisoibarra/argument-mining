As a former bill collector for over 17 years there are alot of ways the industry needs to be cleaned up. I do believe that a debtor should be informed of when a debt is transfered from original creditor to a collector and whether or not that collection agency purchased the debt or if the agency is contracted by the original creditor to collect the debt. There is a big misconception that I see being made in most of these comments that everything is "purchased" which is far from the truth! I personally have not and would not work for an agency that purchased debt, because I know and have heard the horror stories of not only how they treat the debtor but also how the business as a whole treats the collector.
