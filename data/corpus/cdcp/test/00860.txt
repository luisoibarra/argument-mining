A contractor who did work unlicensed was able to file bogus claims against both me and my wife amounting to double the original bid price. there was no court action. I managed to get rid of the debt collector  but there seems nothing I could do to stop another contractor doing the same thing. There should be a penalty for the people filing the false debt. The amount in question was almost $10,000
