There was another debt collector that went after me a second time. First they placed me on their hit list trying to get me to pay the debt of a man with my last name and first initial. I told them that they were contacting the wrong person. Then, several months later, they went after me again, this time looking for a woman with my last name and first initial. After the second round, I send them a cease-communication letter, and they haven't called me again.
