Some useful documents would be the last three collection notices ACTUALLY sent to the consumer. Too many collection agencies have claimed they sent me regular notices regarding the debt when I have not have any contact with them for 2 - 3 years. But they claim they have "records" that claim otherwise. Yet, there is no supporting documentation of such efforts. like say, copies of the notices.
