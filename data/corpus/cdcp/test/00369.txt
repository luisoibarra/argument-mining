I have personally witnessed how judges perceive credit card debt cases, and I believe they have strayed too far towards the debt collectors. Judges simply decide whether a default has occurred, and once a judge declares a debtor in default, the adjudicated debtor has no pleading rights. Alleged credit card and student loan defaulters should have the right to declare their default an Involuntary Default and be allowed to pay back the debt with no more penalties, fees or interest rate charges, called Debt Neutrality. Debt Neutrality is making of a debt neutral so that it does not continue to indenture a defaulter in a never ending cycle of ongoing interest rate charges, penalties and fees. Involuntary defaults should allow the debtor to have the debt reset to where it was at the time of the default minus any payments made. As it stands now, Strategic Defaulters are given much better treatment than Involuntary Defaulters, in large part due to Involuntary Defaulters not being able to plead their default as being Involuntary.
