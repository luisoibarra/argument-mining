Many states have a judgement law where a consumer with over a certain amount of judgements may be terminated from employment. Having a collector call at work just seems to be another way to break down a consumer and put them at a disadvantage. A friend has mentioned to me receiving collection calls at work for one of his employees where the collector identified himself as "Officer" My friend told the collector never to call again and that it's illegal to impersonate law enforcement. Too many other stories that went to court for FDCPA violations of collector harassment at work even when the employer has told the collector not to call there again.
