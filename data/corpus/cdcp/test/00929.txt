The current penalty for violating the FDCPA is "not less than $100 and up to $1000." Further, the violations cannot be "stacked" so those violating the law 10 times on one debt, will generally only face the maximum of a $1000 penalty. Punitive damages are hard to prove. A $1000 penalty is not a deterrent to the debt collection industry,and too low to get most attorney's interest is taking these cases. If we want to see the law upheld, raise the penalty to $10,000 per violation and you'll see most of these characters clean up their act and stop using abusive collection tactics.
