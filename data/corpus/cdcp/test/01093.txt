The CFPB should clarify whether "verify" means verify that you are a legitimate collection agency (not a scam) OR does it mean to prove the legitimacy of the account relative to the debtor's objections. If is the former, some basic information relative to the account--contract, itemized statements, or any other identifying information that only the creditor would have access to would suffice. If CFPB wants "verify" to answer every single objection a debtor can cook up, a collector could never move forward without spending hundreds of hours normally reserved for litigation. As to a time frame on answering, I think the current system of stopping collection action until verification is provided is appropriate. Normally, sending the information to the debtor is not the hard part. Getting the info from the creditor and then circling back around to this particular account is what takes the time. I don't think disputes should be limited to the first 30 days, but should be prohibited once suit has been filed. The Court rules and discovery process provide the debtor all the access to this information they could ever need or want and the provide this access under pretty strict penalties from the Court if the creditor/plaintiff does not provide the info requested.
