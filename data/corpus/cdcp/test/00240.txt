I had a particularly lousy experience with an abusive debt collector called Miracle Financial, working on behalf of Verizon Wireless to collect a debt I wasn't aware I had incurred and didn't believe I owed. The full account -- and dozens more from people leaving comments on my blog over the years -- is available at the supplied link. I had my identity stolen and I didn't even know it. They could not produce a signed credit card receipt to compare my signature.
