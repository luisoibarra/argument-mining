I think the Massachusetts rule is a positive step in the right direction, and would be better than the current situation. However, for those debtors who truly cannot pay at all, due to a serious adverse life event, such as the loss of a job due to a medical disability, their situation is not likely to change from week to week. For example, most disability insurance companies only require a patient's doctor to submit a re-certification of the patient's medical disability every 3, 6, or 12 months. In essence, the debt collector would be acting as a sort of medical re-certification investigator twice a week, which is unnecessary, burdensome on both debtor and collector, and potentially harassing.
