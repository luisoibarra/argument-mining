You are absolutely right. But, you'd be surprised at how many times this does happen and how many times the Credit Bureaus Do change correct information to false information supplied by the 'furnisher/debt collector'. Because I had to send in numerous Certified Letter to the Credit Bureaus, (all of them), in order to stay on top of all the false information and tricks that they did supply. And I have written proof, that this does and is still happening to other consumers, right now.
