I also wanted to add that because debt collectors know they can hire robo service companies to false service, they aren't going to negotiate in good faith. Just as appalling for me was the judge agreeing that the one service I challenged was a false service, but allowing the case to go forward anyways. Sure, people can lie and say they were not served when they were served, but the very day I was in court contesting the service, a person who spoke before me made the comment that they found their service document on their door step when they got home. This means the servicers are lying in court documents, and nobody seems to care. I still want redress on these two cases, and I want to be able to file an errors and omissions claim with both debt collectors insurance company for lying on court documents. And if it is not a law, then isn't it time that debt collection companies carry errors and omissions insurance?
