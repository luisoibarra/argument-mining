I am all for consumers right protection but when you see CFPB, FDCPA and other law they are all to make it difficult for collection agencies to do their honest job. But there is never a talk about consumers responsibilities. I agree that some collection agencies are aggressive. but I think a good honest collection agencies also need their rights to do honest work.
