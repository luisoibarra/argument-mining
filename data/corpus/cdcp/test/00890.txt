I have had my cell phone number for 4 1/2 years; the previous owner of my number had a student loan debt.... I cannot get collection agencies to stop calling me! Every time I emphatically tell them I'm not the person in question  and the person dutifully "takes me off the list". But in another few months I hear from them (or probably a collector who bought the list) all over again. I'm familiar with the FDCPA, but I don't think it currently provides a practical solution for me.
