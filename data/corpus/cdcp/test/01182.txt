It is the responsibility of the creditor and debt collectors to report accurate information. Reporting accurate information has nothing to do with "debt collectors who don't report to credit reporting agencies at all." If a debt collector reported accurately that the debt in question has not been paid, but now is, it is the responsibility of that debt collector to report the newly accurate information. As I too have noticed, some debt collectors will not accurately report updated information to the credit bureaus once they are paid.
