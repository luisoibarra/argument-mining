As I have had many accounts in collection due to an identity theft, I have several different experiences with the "validation" process.My belief is that there is no rule defining exactly what documentation constitutes validation.As we know, if we dispute with the CRA and ask for a reinvestigation, all that will be done is the social security number will be matched and verified with the amount owed. It is a useless tool and a waste of the consumer's time.Asking for validation with a collection agency is almost as useless.This is because current laws suggest that the collection agency provide the consumer with information "such as" the name and address of the original creditor, and the amount owed.This does not prove a debt is still owed, and to whom it is owed.If we are going to allow companies to buy debts for amounts as low as pennies on the dollar, then the burden of proof MUST lie with the collection agency.As they are in the business of collecting debts,they are given all information regarding payment history, original contracts, methods of prior payment, and all personal information relating to the consumer.For far too long the consumer has been at the mercy of the collection agency.We are forced to send proof of our identity, current mailing address, phone number, etc. as well as all documentation we have regarding the account that would show an error has been made.The collection agency has this information readily available.And if they do not, the account should be permanently deleted.If the collection agency cannot produce documentation from the original creditor including (1)a contract (2)payment history from original creditor if any (3)proper identification of the consumer (4)proof of purchase of the debt (5)proof they are legally able to collect on the debt in the consumer's state-then there should be laws in place that prevent the debt from being reported.In most cases, it is being reported from the original creditor already.And if it isn't, this should be a red flag to CRA's that the debt is not valid.Collection agencies must be able to show proof that a collection notice was sent,and they should be required to provide the same proof a consumer must provide to prove a dispute was sent (CMRR).If it is required of the consumer, it should be required of all.A debt should be considered validated only when all of these conditions have been met.Without these safeguards, a consumer could end up paying a debt they do not owe.It happens all the time.How many stories have you heard of collection agencies voluntarily providing any information to a consumer before demanding money?They don't.Enough is enough.Take the burden of proof off the consumer and place it with the party that legally owns the debt.
