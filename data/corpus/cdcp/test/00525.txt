AT & T is notorious for setting up new accounts that don't have an official phone number attached. I was put in the situation of having an 800 number that AT & T customer service reps could not find in their system. I had no way to cancel it! Eventually the false 100 dollar debt went to a debt collector. I respectfully explained that the debt was not valid, in a letter. A few months later I got a letter from a different debt collector. Again I wrote a letter. A few months later another letter over the same faux debt from a third debt collector.
