Verifying the debt by the collector is a must. I had an instance where the bill was sent to wrong address. After 6 months I got a call reg the debt. They mentioned only the amount and the service provider. when service provider was contacted they said already it is on collection and we're not helpful. i asked them to send the Bill to pay it off. Only more calls from collector started. After almost 6/7 requests to the collector the bill detail was sent . On verification with my bank statement I found out that the amount had been paid. When confronted both the collector and service provider did not bother to apologize for the mistake. It is a case of non verification.
