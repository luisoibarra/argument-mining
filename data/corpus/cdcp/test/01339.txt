I think the cost of education needs to be reduced to a more reasonable amount or repayment plans need to be income based. As far as consumer protection, legal aid needs to be made available, affordable and effective, and consumers need to take time to really know their rights and stop complaining about harassment because that's a completely different cause of action than restitution.
