I do not believe that it would have mattered. It seemed that the Attorney/debt collector was not looking for the actual debtor I believe that all that they were trying to do was to make a quick buck. They did a couple of shady things with this case. For a solution; the laws should be written so the common lay person can understand. If I had known that a validation request would not be considered I would not have wasted my time and paid even though it was NOT my debt.
