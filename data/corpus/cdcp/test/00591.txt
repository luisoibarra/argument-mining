The enforcement mechanism of the FDCPA is laughable from the point of view of the debtor. For example, a debt collector said that since they are out of the country they are not required to adhere to the FDCPA. Luckily, I knew better,  but most folk don't. The CFPB's voluntary reporting combined with proxy enforcement power may curb the industry's activities, and may be cheaper and faster than class action lawsuits.
