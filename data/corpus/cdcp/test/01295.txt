After a court verdict in favor of a debt collector, Banks assess a significant fee against a customer when a customer's account is levied by the debt collector , even if there are scant funds in the account on the day the levy is imposed. Explain how assessing a 125 dollar bank levy fee when an account has 50 dollars in it helps resolve the ongoing debt resolution. The Debt collector gets nothing and the customer is hit with a 125 dollar bank levy fee. Why isn't there a 100 dollar float that is impervious to a bank levy fee and protected from the debt collector's clutches as well? Once again, we get back to the same underpinning, Judges who simply decide on whether a default has occurred without caring why the default occurred are basically rubber stamping minions of a system corrupted by a lack of fairness. People can lose income based on circumstances beyond their control, yet the system doesn't even blanche an eye. A debtor who purposely runs up debt quickly and defaults is treated identically to someone who had a perfect payment history but had to stop working to become a CareGiver for a family member. A debtor who purposely runs up debt quickly and hires a lawyer can strategically default and possibly get a better resolution than an honest person with an impeccable payment history who has lost income because of an event beyond their control.
