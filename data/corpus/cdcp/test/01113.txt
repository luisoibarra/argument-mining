paythefiddler, It's not just innocent family members that debt collectors go after, it's also perfect strangers. I have a common last name, no debts, and have been the target of many debt collectors. All of the deadbeats have had my common last name and first initial. Once a debt collector has me on their hit list, they don't stop calling until I sent them a cease-communication letter. They want me to pay the debt to get them to stop.
