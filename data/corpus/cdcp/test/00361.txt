If I ever tell a collector that I'm recording the conversation, the call ends rather abruptly or the calls just stop. Yet, I'm expected to be recorded whenever they initiate the call. They expect me to have an expectation to be recorded when they want to attempt to collect a debt,  but the minute I want to record them while I dispute a debt, that's out of bounds...
