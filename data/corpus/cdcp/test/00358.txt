There should be a federal rule prohibiting collectors from reporting information to a CRA during the 30-day window. There are automated processes in place with many collectors where they will generate 4 collection letters at one time, including the one where they tell you that they have reported you to a CRA. And then they will mail all those to letters (all dated on the same day) to you at the same time. And this is done without any debt verification whatsoever.
