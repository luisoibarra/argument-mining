To avoid consumers getting sued repeatedly on the same debt, the CFPB should require or encourage states to adopt rules requiring that judgments be preclusive of future consumer-collector litigation on the same debt; instead, if there is a dispute between assignees as to who has title to the debt, they should work it out between themselves instead of risking subjecting the consumer to multiple liability.
