If the present mortgage repayment debacle is any indication of noticing or added noticing I think it is much simpler to notify the consumer whom to pay and list the original creditor name. Also, I think it would be a good idea for CFPB and the industry to combine this with FCRA issues. For example, if a consumer today reviews their credit reports the normal term is "sold to another lender" but no name. I have heard similar stories from attorneys who try to match what a consumer lists as a creditor versus what is listed in a credit report. Seems to me that everyone is trying to close the back door but leaving the front door open.
