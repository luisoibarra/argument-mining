With increased and onerous liability for making calls and sending letters to debtors, creditors and debt buyers have had little option but to file suit rather than repeatedly attempt to contact an uncooperative or uncommunicative debtor. Most complaints provide adequate and identifying information about the debt. In my experience, most debtors don't feel taken advantage of by lawsuits, they simply understand they owe the debt so there is little point in filing an answer or taking time to appear in court. In fact, the vast majority never respond to a Federal Law letter inviting them to dispute the debt. Filing suits and appearing in court is expensive and time consuming for creditors and debt buyer, but there is little alternative, nor should there be as these matters have always been governed appropriately by State law and State judges. and the US is a credit ecomony over 70% of our economy is based on consumer spending  which comes mainly from credit extensions and not consumers pay increases), there are simply more defaults, particularly in a Great Recession. Any heavy handed Federal regulation will hamper and restrict credit granting and debt buying, both of which are needed by the economy and the credit industry. While credit grantors should should make their documentation retention systems more accessible and share more documents upon a sale of accounts, a lack of documentation should not hamper State court lawsuits when a debtor offers no dispute so long as the account is adequately identified in a complaint. In Michigan, efforts to "make it more likely that consumers would defend themselves" have fell very flat for the reasons mentioned above. As it has always been, the protections are in place and are used by those debtors that wish to avail themselves of them. Judges are there to listen. However, most debtors (bless them) understand they simply owe the debt.
