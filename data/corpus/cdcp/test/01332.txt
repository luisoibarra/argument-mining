I have dealt with the issue of disputes and when you file a dispute and it as been closed it is placed in the comment section that you have filed a dispute.By doing this, this has kept me from refinancing my home just because the word dispute was there.The mortgage company said I had to have this removed,so I filed another form to ask for this to be removed it never was.I believe that once the dispute has been closed there should be no indication that there was a dispute filed.You again get penalized for trying to correct mistakes on your report.Another issue that has come up regarding when an account has been charged off or in my case a repossession of a vehicle I had turn over due to not being released by my doctor to go back to work and my disability ran out , I had no other choice but to hand the vehicle over.then 6 years later I received a 1099 for over $6000.00.Plus the 16% interest they charged me for 4 years.We keep paying these high interest rates but yet we still have to pay for our credit scores and only receive one free report a year,If we are trying to stay on top of credit fraud and inaccurate information that is not of our doing but from reporting agencies , these agencies should be putting more funds in for these things.
