I think they should have to have a license to be debt collectors and at the time they did not. Additionally there should be harassment laws regarding just this matter about landlords as if someone sues you 3Xs for the same thing, they should lose their collections license. I even responded from the very beginning with a certified letter stating that I did not owe any part of the debt! Additionally what did help after almost 20 years was reporting the landlords real estate license for violating business practices in NYS for overcharging rent statements. This certainly got their attention  however I still had to retain an attorney for a lawsuit against them and prevailed  but then you have to pay the 20% of what you recoup to the attorney. I wish they would just lose their license for harassing you for 20 years. It is disgusting that no one in NYC has done anything about it but then I don't need to tell you how corrupt everyone there is and that includes the legal system. NYC government and housing system is like dealing with the mob and I say that after having to deal with them aggressively for the past 3 years after being attacked for almost 20
