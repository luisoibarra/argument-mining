Consumers who ask for validation should receive just that: a validation that the agency has verified the balance due has some basis as alleged. Too often consumers categorize this process as requiring "proof" as taxguy does. This is not the function of the validation process. "Proof" is something that will occur in court (or not). No document will be enough "proof" for many consumers. That is why the court system exists.
