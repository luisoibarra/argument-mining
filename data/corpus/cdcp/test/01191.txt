My only concern about this excellent comment is that consumers not be subjected to a flood of confusing or potentially intimidating information. The most useful information is the what, when, who, and why of the original transaction that incurred the unpaid debt. The original creditor should be identified by a name known to the consumer, e.g. DR. JOHN SMITH, RHEUMATOLOGIST not DYNAMIC HEALTHCARE OF GREATER ANYTOWN d/b/a ASSOCIATED SPECIALISTS P.C. You get the idea.
