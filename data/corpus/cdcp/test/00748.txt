Patience is the number one option. Agree to contact the credit card company and have the debt reduced to what it was at the time of default. Agree to even a 5 dollar monthly autopay with the promise that eventually it will be increased. Then report the account in good standing to the credit bureaus as long as those five dollar payments come in.
