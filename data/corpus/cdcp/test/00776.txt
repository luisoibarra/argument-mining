what kind of consumer contacts do debt collectors... disputing the debt. That presumes they actually follow the law and do a validation investigation. That is wrong, they do not. I sent a letter to a company claiming I owed a debt and I was clear I was disputing the debt. A clear, declaratory sentence. I mailed it to the address listed. There was NO PERSON who signed this letter to me. I had to send it to To Whom It Concerned. But it was clear I was disputing the debt. I did so within two weeks, well within the 30 days. Yet they did nothing but wait 30 days and send me a letter saying "here is the info you requested." It contained nothing I recognized. You are presuming they are actually validating. This is the biggest mistake. They do none of that. Any rule that defines what qualifies as a dispute would help. The clearer, the better. The vagueness now has led to abuses. Such as "frivolous and irrelevant" disputes. That is a license to abuse consumers.
