Clear communication helps everyone, not just consumers. I think debt collectors when trying to collect just send bills, and everyone knows what a bill is. But when they devolve into harassment, they blur the lines between trying to collect debt within the law and behaving in misleading and abusive ways toward consumers. TRuly, the robot calling, the letters, they have money enough for this. If they communicated clearly up front, they would save more money. The post office is still a good deal, not an expensive way to communicate. You are missing the boat on the problem, though. It is not the costs or whether they should communicate. Most of these companies hire people who are barely literate, poorly trained and certainly uninformed -- wait, UNINFORMED -- about the laws that already exist regarding debt collection. That is a huge problem when trying to get information from an employee who doesn't know the law requires him/her to provide certain information. This has come about from decades of lack of oversight, in my opinion. Lack of oversight, lack of clear rules and lack of enforcement. So, if they don't have to worry about following the law, they hire whoever they can cheap and don't bother to train them. This is why there are so many of these companies and after some of them do get in trouble, they just change their name and keep on doing the same law-breaking habits.
