This is the PROBLEM over and over Why should lawyers get a pass from rules of the Bar Associations or rules of the court because they are now considered "debt collectors" even I did not know this, though I have seen advertised quite a bit lawyers in the "collection" business. This is wrong. I hope if anything, this very thing is addressed. Using a lawyer to send a letter is often a way to intimidate. People become too frightened to even respond. The rules are blown off by lawyers who go into this debt collection business  because they make a fast easy buck, and they know the debtor has very little recourse, and there is so few rules that protect the consumer/debtor. Being in debt stopped being a crime decades ago, but the lack of rules that protect the debtor are bringing back these draconian practices. Uniformity, is needed, and making lawyers abide by the rules of the Bar. Just two right off. It is bringing to light why this system has become so fraught with abuse.
