I appreciate Mr. Bartmann's comments but they appear to be grounded in a collection agency perspective  (there is always business and market share tension between collection agencies and law firms). The reality is that (and this was voiced by other participants) many (not all but many) debtors simply won't/can't pay until they have to. The FDCPA and TCPA have truly made communications with debtor both difficult and hazardous for the collector. For instance, the fact that you can't safely leave a voice message for a debtor should be very troubling. Over the years, our firm has stopped initial outbound calling (responding only to inbound calls) and also limited our pre-suit letters to just two. We send the required disclosure letter and (there being no response and the account reviewed for suit) then send a discounted payment offer that says we are going to file suit but would rather settle. We offer reasonable terms to the debtors to avoid a costly suit but  the response rate is absolutely miserable, probably in the single digits percentage wise. Believe me, suits are time consuming and expensive,  but they are often simply the only option. Even when the debtors are served, few contact us, and even fewer when the court sends them the judgment. Worse, a judgment doesn't guarantee payment on the account. Clarification via Regulations as to what we can say and do in communications would at least promote more communication between the parties. With that, perhaps more points of contact could resolve debts before suit. I strongly disagree that litigation should be "discouraged" as it is not only a simple reality in much of debt collection but a fundamental right of a creditor. However, I think Regulations making it clear what can and cannot be done in communications that can shield the industry from the wild west of FDCPA and TCPA lawsuits would greatly encourage more communication. I also think a reasonable, good faith attempt to resolve the case (offering a payment plan and/or lump sum) before suit is filed is still a good idea as well  even though our own response rate has not been great. Anything more will infringe on a creditor's rights and interfere with state law. Perhaps the CFPB Portal could have a debt resolution aspect to it where a debtor could try to resolve an account in a "safer" more disarming manner.
