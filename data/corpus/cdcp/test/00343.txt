I am not a lawyer, but I have noticed that credit card agreements often contain statements advising consumers that if suit is brought, it will occur in a specified jurisdiction or "as provided for by law." At the point where collectors start suing consumers is where many consumers say enough and hire a bankruptcy attorney. The only winner in that situation is the bankruptcy attorney.
