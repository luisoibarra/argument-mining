Ummm you want to know a annoying way to find out I was in collections... how about 12 voicemails saying they are bill collectors. Finding time to call you is not easy. Many of you work from 9 to 6. Thats when im at work. Some of you are different timezones. Why cant I text or email you and haveyou text or email me back" So stone age!
