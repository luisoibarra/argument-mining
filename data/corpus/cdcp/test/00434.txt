I had one debt collector in particular who called me a liar when I told him I wasn't the person he was looking for. This was after he violated the FDCPA by calling me at 7:00 on a Saturday morning. I called them back immediately and spoke with a supervisor who said she'd take me off their hit list. I asked her if she got my number out of the phone book. She claimed that they had not. A few months later, they started in on me again. Obviously they still considered me a liar. I sent them a cease-communication letter with a copy to my state's Attorney General, who has been wonderful in all this. At that point, I started sending out letters every time I received a collection call,  and, other than the one, none ever called me again. At one point I was receiving daily calls from one collector or another. I can name names, and I have a thick file folder full of copies of my letters and responses to my Attorney General. It has been a wild ride, and I sure hope it's over. I'm approaching the one-year anniversary of my most recent collection call. I just wish they wouldn't use the phone book as their primary research tool. Thank you for providing me this forum.
