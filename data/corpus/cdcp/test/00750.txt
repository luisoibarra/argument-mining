Bonzarel. while I think your idea is a good one, it could open the floodgates to interest rate padding the debt until it reaches one of the "floors" that you are suggesting. 30% interest rate charges, penalties and fees (which in turn also get hit with a 30% interest rate charge), can accelerate even a 500 dollar debt into the thousands in less than 24 months time.
