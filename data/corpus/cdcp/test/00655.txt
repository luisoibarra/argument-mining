If a debt is to be sold, the owner of the debt should be required to send an itemized statement to the debtor. The statement should have a large-type header, something like, "[NAME OF CREDITOR] IS SELLING THIS DEBT TO [NAME OF DEBT BUYER]." This would give the debtor another chance to pay in the simplest way, before getting tangled up in idiot phone calls,  and it would help the debtor identify the debt.
