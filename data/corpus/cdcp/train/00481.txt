It seems that just about anyone can create a debt collection company and if the owners and/or employees have unscrupulous desires, then it seems that privacy is a big concern. Plus, if anyone can create/own debt collection companies, then it doesn't seem to surprise me why so many debt collecting companies break the laws. There should be tighter laws on the formation of debt collection companies and the employees that they can hire.
