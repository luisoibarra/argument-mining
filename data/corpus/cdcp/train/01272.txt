A question that I'd ask surrounds dialects. There are numerous dialects for Spanish, French, etc. and it would be very expensive for agencies to translate every letter into every dialect of a certain language, Spanish being the most common for this type of occurrence. I'd greatly appreciate feedback, commentary and also recommendations on everyone's view on how to address differing language formalities.
