This Draft Summary of Discussion fails to address the issues of confusion about the statute of limitations and how they vary among states. This is a big source of confusion in terms of collection of a debt and jurisdiction. Creating a more stanadrized set of rules would alleviate these problems. In 2010, the FTC released a report, "Repairing A Broken System," which made mention of the need a universal statute of limitations. Additionally, in 2011 ACA's plan, "The Path Forward: ACA International"s Blueprint for Modernizing America"s Consumer Debt Collection System" also advocated for a national statute of limitations. This is something that both sides of the industry actually agree upon. 50 different states and 50 different statutes make it too confusing for consumers. I also reiterate that a compromise in terms of years can be reached. Also, debt tolling needs to be done away with. It only adds to the confusion of when a debt becomes time-barred. We live in a transient society. A debt should not legally follow a person for the rest of their life: Repairing A Broken System - Federal Trade Commission: __URL__ InsideArm: Statutes of Limitations Frustrate Debt Collectors and Consumers __URL__ The Path Forward: ACA International"s Blueprint for Modernizing America"s Consumer Debt Collection System: __URL__
