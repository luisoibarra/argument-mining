Creditors should only be allowed to call between the hours of 9am until 7pm local time unless they have written consent (maybe even a web form) that gives them a minimum 3 hour window in which to call. Additionally, they are limited to 3 phone calls a day maximum. If they leave a message they should be required to leave the name of the company, the name of the representative, the number to call, and a reference number. In regards to debt sales, the entity selling the debt should give 90 days notice of the intent to sell giving the consumer notification of the intent to sell and maybe even offer a settlement amount. The entity purchasing the debt must honor any and all terms of the debt they are purchasing (i.e. payment plans, deferment/forbearance, etc.). My brother has several private student loans. About a year ago we started getting phone calls from Discover in regards to student loans and we all assumed that it was a sales call because no one living at my address had student loans with them. Eventually we managed to be home when they called  and we discovered that two of my brother's loans were sold to Discover  and he was never notified. So all this time thinking it was a sales call, because Discover only gave a 1-800 number to call about student loans and not even the name of the person they were trying to reach, his loans were actually in default  because Discover cancelled the forbearance he had upon purchase. When he attempted to put them back into forbearance, Discover told him they "didn't have a system for that yet".
