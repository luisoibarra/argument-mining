You are correct. There is quite a difference between send and receive. All I am suggesting is that a creditor only be required to send any notice to the last known address - not that the consumer receive it. and you presume too much if you think that all mail is returned if not delivered to the proper recipeint), then the creditor must send the notice to that new address. If the point of this dialogue is to ensure the consumer is protected, then require the consumer to protect themselves and provide this information to the creditor. If they don't then a creditor can't be hanged in a lawsuit for a letter failing to reach a consumer, when the creditor actions used the best information on hand.
