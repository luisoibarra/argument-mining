I used to have a lot of debt and told every single company that called to send me something in the mail. I paid every single debt that I received mail for. Years later someone went after me  and me, not knowing the rules, got stuck with it. I still have not seen anything in writing to even verify what the debt is for  - and the court wasn't any better -  I didn't even have a chance to talk to the judge. How is this right?
