This proposed rulemaking is not about credit reporting. I understand that people have significant concerns about their credit reports. But that belongs in a reform of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, not the FDCPA. Inserting credit reporting rules into the FDCPA would make things difficult for debt collectors who don't report to credit reporting agencies at all.
