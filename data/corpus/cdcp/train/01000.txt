A credit reporting agency should be required to immediately comply with information regarding disputed debt and completely remove any reference to the debt. As an example, I am attempting to have a time barred paid lien removed from my Credit Report. 2 of the 3 bureaus immediately removed, 1 refuses to remove. I have sent documentation from the court, the original creditor, from the office of probate judge all to no avail. Without a remedy, I am left with a false item on my credit report.
