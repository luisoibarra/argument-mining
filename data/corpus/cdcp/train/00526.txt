I dont understand why bill collectors are so stuck in ancient times. I get so many calls and its annoying. I would much rather get a text or email. The phone ringing can be annoying and a text is more subtle. It also doesnt require me to hear a long dragging voicemail. I would rather get a text saying who they are and what they want. If I dont respond soon then call me.
