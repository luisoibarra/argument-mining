Though I do not agree with "someone to rack up tens of thousands of dollars of debt and never pay it back". My current standing is that the laws of each and every state allow for higher interest rates to be charged for non-secured debt. This is because the lenders take more losses  "the risk should be in alignment with the award". In many cases the principal has been paid back in full or the majority of the debt has been paid back. To allow a "third party" to buy it at a significantly reduced price, after the debt has been charged off by the original "lender/creditor" AND allow the third party to collect the full alleged balance and interest is not just. This is the way I am leaning at this time. Explain to me why you or I feel differently?
