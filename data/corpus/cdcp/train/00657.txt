My experience is only with medical bills. The debt collectors seem only to know (a) what hospital and (b) how much. When you've been doing the hokey-pokey from emergency room to nursing home and back again over a period of months, that information is not much help. What's really needed is an itemized bill that's a lot clearer than the "statement of benefits" we get now. Something as clear as: "You were in X hospital on this date. You had this test and that test. They cost a gazillion dollars, but we bargained them down to $17.48. Please pay this amount."
