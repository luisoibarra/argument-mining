If I am paying for the minutes on my phone, which I do, then I should be able to chose who's call I do and do not want to answer. When it comes up 'unknown", how do I know it's a Collection Agency, a telemarketer trying to sell me vacation homes, cruse lines trying to sell me a cruse, someone wanting to offer me a better mortgage rate, ect... Every call I answer deducts time from my minutes  and that is NOT fair to me. I now block ALL "unknown, withheld & private" calls. If they truly are legidimate and want to talk to me, press 1 to unblock, just like I have to.
