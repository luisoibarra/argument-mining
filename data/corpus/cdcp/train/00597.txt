I have received calls from debt collectors at 9:30 pm, and I consider this rude. I have also had robocalls early in the morning that woke me up. I am 69 yrs old, and retired,  and I sleep late. My health is not good at the moment,  so sometimes I have had a bad night please, please don't wake me up with a robocall.
