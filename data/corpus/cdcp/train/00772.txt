I was not the one with debt. I was a mediator trying to help. The people with this situation sometimes ignore the first notice to them and don't ask for a validation letter. Others, I believe, do not read it carefully and see they have a small window of time to dispute the claim. I think the original notice letter to the debtor should HIGHLIGHT the part about a validation letter. I also, think the original creditor should be required to help resolve disputes instead of debtors or third parties like me only being able to talk with the collection agency. Probably 50% of the agencies I have dealt with do not follow existing regulations. Without penalties they never will. The few that are reasonable and follow the rules are a pleasure to deal with, as a third party.
