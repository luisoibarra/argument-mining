The collection agency is not required to actually validate the debt and provide information to the consumer. Example, I disputed a debt as valid. The return validation consisted of a one line sentence: "The consumer owes the debt." This is not to me or to any reasonable person validation. The collection agency should be required to at least furnish enough information to allow the consumer to recognize or dispute the debt. That information ideally would be a copy of the original application and a copy of the final billing statement.
