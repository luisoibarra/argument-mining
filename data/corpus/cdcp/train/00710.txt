I had a 19 year old debt come back to haunt me I went to three attorney's to attempt to pay them to "talk" to the company, as the information I was given, would not call me back after leaving several messages, along with an offer to settle it for slightly more than one-half of what they claimed I owed. This debt went from around $1200 up to $9,300 in those 19 years. This type of behavior must be regulated it is only out and out a scam.
