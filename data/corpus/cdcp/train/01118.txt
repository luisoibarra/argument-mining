Unless and until debt collection practices have greater transparency for consumers there will be abuses and misunderstandings regarding legal liability. It's too much a pat answer to say consumers should seek legal advice. Collectors should be required to say with a certain level of supported certainty whether the debt is valid or not. Collectors should not be allowed to rely merely on a borrower's "moral obligation" to repay the debt. Financially disadvantaged, naive, and gullible consumers, and specifically those individuals on fixed, limited incomes, i.e., older Americans, ESL citizens, etc. are especially vulnerable.
