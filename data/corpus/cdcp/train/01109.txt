There are still too often abuses by debt collectors in regard to time-barred debts. Zombie debt collectors who use partial payments, acknowledgement of the debt in writing, or other tactics are effectively hard-wiring around the laws having to do with the statute of limitations. I have witnessed situations where consumers were effectively tricked into setting up a series of payments on a long time-barred debt. Collectors continue to take advantage of consumers for whom ESL and also those who are unsophisticated and possibly naive.
