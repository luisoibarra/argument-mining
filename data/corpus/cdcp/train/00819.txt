Why can't we bring back the olden days? I have been a "victim" of debt collectors run amok for over 35 years. Back in the day, a debt was assigned to one collector who would pursue me relentlessly for a debt that belonged to someone else. Nowadays with the robo-dialers the collection call is assigned to the "next available operator." Why not just go back to the days when only one collector was responsible for making the contact?
