I live in Florida where proof of the debt is getting difficult for debt buyers to prove without them falsifying documents. I currently have a case where the Debt bill of sale was whited out in three places, sadly these documents were filed by an attorney at law registered with the Florida Bar Association. Debt buyers have no scruples
