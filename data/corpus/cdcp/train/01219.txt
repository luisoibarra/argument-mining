I agree that expanding the scope of the validation notice would benefit consumers. Especially important is a means for the consumer to contact the original creditor and identify the account in question. When debts are sold multiple times it becomes impossible for consumers to: (1) determine if the account is theirs; (2) validate proper assignment; and (3) determine if the statute of limitations has expired. The current requirements facilitate "zombie debt" accounts which - although already paid by the consumer - come back to life again and again. Absent a means for consumers to identify an account there is no way for them to verify that they have previously paid that debt.
