Periodically (probably when the debt has been sold) I receive harassing phone calls from collection companies regarding a believed debt that my nephew owes. I send him Christmas cards annually, see him at family gatherings every 5 years or so, and stopped contacting him about this harassment after he assured me it had already been taken care of when I received my first call. These calls happen about once a year for a couple weeks at a time.
