Your point is understandable; however the statement you referred to is known as the mini-Miranda. This statement is a requirement in a debt collector's initial communication and in some states every communication). Typically, the validation verbiage is included in a sheet of it's own with several other disclosures a debt collector is required to provide. As far as law being slanted against the consumer, I would disagree. The laws surrounding contacting consumers and the information required to be given is quite stringent, the problem is the channels which are directly regulated by the law are outdated. The primary law that regulates a debt collector was written in the 70's and did not directly define that is thrown around all too often, harassment (among others). Because of this, if a debt collector sends a letter and makes a phone call, he may very well be held accountable in a court of law for "harassment". Most collectors settle out of court as defending a suit as frivolous as the one described above would cost much more than settling with a consumer.
