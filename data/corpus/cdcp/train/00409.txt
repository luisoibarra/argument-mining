while this isn't the best forum for me to go into my company's entire collection process, we work a debt for at least 120 days with letters, live agent calls, robo calls, emails, mailed invoices, and by suspending subscription service (where allowed) as part of our collection campaign. Even then, we only go to litigation after the debtor has been unresponsive to our attempts to contact them. I've found that if a debtor talks to their creditors, many times creditors will take their situation into account. I've offered lengthy repayment plans, reduced or waived interest or late fees, or partial settlement for those explain their hardship. But if a debtor is uncooperative or doesn't respond to our attempts to work out a balance, what other alternatives do creditors have?
