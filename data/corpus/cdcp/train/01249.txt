Social Media: While the courts have made the rare exception for use of social media as a means of giving notice, not everyone is on every social media platform.I am very internet savy yet I am not on foursquare, pinterest and several others.On FB, Twitter and others there are several thousand people with my name who may get incorrectly notified.
