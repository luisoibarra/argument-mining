I contacted the debt collection company and tried to make arrangements for payment of debt, the reason I could not pay my bills is my husband was laid off work and he had started a new job. I wanted to make payments of $100. a month, debt collectors said NO, so I said the most I could afford was $200 a month the said NO they wanted $1,000. a month. Now we have 4 children, a mortgage and utility payment, debt collection said $500 a month my husband brought home after taxes $1,100 twice a month. My mortgage is $1,300 per month not including utilizes so I told debt company that I couldn't pay. I always thought something was better than nothing and that a debt company would try to work with you. I learned that they won't work with you.
