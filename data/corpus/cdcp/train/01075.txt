Someone keeps calling for a person named Sean, who does not live here and I don't know anyone by that name. I tell them they have the wrong number, but they continue to call. They sometimes leave canned messages on my answering machine. I realize some debtors pretend not to be at the number being called,  but these collectors need to verify the information  so they don't keep calling the wrong number. I don't know if the debtor gave the wrong number intentionally, or this number was used by someone else before I got it. It is extremely irritating. And even though the callers do not say they are debt collectors, it is obvious.
