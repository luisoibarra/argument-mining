Breaking a promise to pay isn't the same as breaking the law. We can't keep comparing criminal law to civil law  because it's just not the same. But the item that's missing here is the legitimacy of interest. Forget about big banks for a minute,  and think about borrowing money from a friend or neighbor. When you keep money that is rightfully owed to someone else, you damage him, because he doesn't have that money, which he could be investing (to increase it) or spending (to improve his quality of life). That's one of the reasons that interest exists to compensate someone for the loss of their money for a portion of time until it gets repaid. I'm not saying interest rates aren't excessive they certainly are unfortunately, that's a separate issue. But suspending interest all together and allowing a debtor to freeze the amount of his debt indefinitely, because he borrowed more than he could pay back and didn't plan for unexpected expenses.... I don't know anyone who would loan money under those terms, except for maybe Mom and Dad.
