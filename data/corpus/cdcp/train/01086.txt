The Michigan program for handling NSF checks is outlined in Michigan statute (MCL 600.2952). The statute provides the exact language to be used in the demand notice to the debtor but does not include the FDCPA Miranda language- which we add to the notice. We also send a copy of the dishonored check with the notice. The statute allows the debtor to pay the value of the check plus $25 is paid within 30 days of the notice, or $35 if paid thereafter. IF the creditor brings suit (after the first 30 days) they can sue for the value of the check, PLUS damages of 2 times the amount of the dishonored check PLUS $250 in costs. This may even be used in small claims court. It seems that the idea is to penalize those who pass bad checks such that merchants will be willing to accept checks from customers.
