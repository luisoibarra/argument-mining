As an "authorized user" who has no access to the actual credit card, my credit rating is suffering because the "account holder" presently, is only able to make the minimum monthly payments.I don't think this is fair and have not been able to get a direct response from anyone to see if card companies can legally do this when they collected no information from me but my name!There was NO FULL DISCLOSURE stating that as only being an "authorized user" said card company would report on my credit report.
