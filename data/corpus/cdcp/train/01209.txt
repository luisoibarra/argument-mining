Marian makes an excellent point about how Debt Collectors are paid. They try to get as much money upfront as possible. Ironically, if they get too much money upfront, the credit card company might snatch the account back from the debt collector. If the amount is "too low" that the debt collector receives, they are not interested. This goes against many sales principles that it is easier to interact at a later date with a paying customer versus trying to make a big score all at once.
