If a bank is going to sell a consumer's debt, the bank should be required to notify that consumer IN ADVANCE, and allow that consumer a fair chance to bid on and purchase his/her own debt, on terms just as favorable as the terms offered to any other debt buyer (which at present is usually pennies on the dollar). Debt buyers contribute nothing to society. Yet, they are allowed to obtain windfall profits by pursuing impoverished consumers for the full face value of such debts. This proposal would entail changes more extensive that just "notice"  as it would require a change from bulk loan sales, to requiring an opportunity to purchase individual loan in certain circumstances.
