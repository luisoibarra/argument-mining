it still bothers me that "financial literacy" may be the escape clause that the CFPB uses to avoid the real issue. How about rewarding those of us who have tirelessly blogged about exposing the financial traps set up by the credit card companies, especially those of us who did it all on our own dime and time. Credit Cards are THE BIGGEST PROFIT MAKING scheme in the U.S., much bigger than the mortgage industry. And as the CFPB knows, any type of money making machine gets protected through lobbying. That is exactly why the CFPB was able to fine the credit card companies well over 1/2 billion dollars for aggressively marketing the credit-protector Insurance program. When something makes so much money so easily, people just can't help themselves to try and keep expanding the money making venture. I personally warned about the credit card credit protector programs almost FIVE YEARS BEFORE the CFPB made their over half billion in fines. Credit-Protector __URL__ I created my site on my own time and with no funding, and I think my warning almost five years before should matter. I also don't understand why someone like myself who created my warning so early on, with no funding, can't be compensated on any level simply as a way to energize future generations that if they take the time and show they care for something that matters, they may someday be publicly rewarded/acknowledged. I also created blogs about Chase Bank and their credit card shenanigans back in 2009. Once again, the class action lawyers swooped in and took 25 million dollars in legal fees. I didn't see a dime for my blogging even though my 2009 protest blogs probably helped fuel the justified anger by some consumers who then went on a mission to get a class action lawyer involved. Once again, I got nothing. If Government Consumer Organizations are not willing to acknowledge those who care and show it, the system may never truly improve.

The tree fell, people heard it, but no one made a sound.
