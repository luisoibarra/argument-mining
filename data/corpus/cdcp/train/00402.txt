I was never informed by Bank of America that they sold my credit card and closed the card. When I realized it, I paid it off immediately. During that quarter, after long illnesses, my Father and Mother both passed (within 31 days of each other)  and frankly, credit card payments were not in the forefront of my thinking. ALSO, just because a bank or credit card company has been exempted from Usury laws does not mean they do not commit the violation! THAT needs to be stopped!
