The state, county, city make their own laws. That is what I have ran into and if a person does not hire a lawyer, are not a big group, there isn't much hope for the consumer. The law where everyone may hire a lawyer has limits--IE: Will not take a criminal or money cases if a non profit org. or free lawyer takes the case. I darn sure do not understand the laws etc. and I have tried to read about all this for 2 years. Of course I'm old and 100% DAV, that could be it.
