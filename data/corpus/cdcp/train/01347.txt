False of misleading are rearranging paper work to suit their claims, false allegations against the lender, personal harassment, humiliation on credit reports, preventing students from seeking consolidation form other companies. Other false or misleading is the assumption that students dont want to repay their loans. That is not true. They also mix up the paper work so much it is difficult to get to the bottom of why the loans are in default in the first place. They need to streamline their services and offer students option in the private loan sector. The institutions should do the same because they treat student loans like mortgage loans.
