Right now collectors are legally required to stop phone contact when notified by the consumer. They do not stop. And the law is not enforced. Reporting violations to regulators does nothing except get the complainant into some sort of database,  and the regulators are never heard from again. There are decent laws on the books. It's the enforcement that is a failure.
