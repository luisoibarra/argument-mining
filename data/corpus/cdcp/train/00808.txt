The debt collector who harassed me did that number one on the "three others" I got calls saying "hey we'll settle for" such and such. It was a medical debt  and I was tempted to say why?  There is only going to be more medical debt. When times are that difficult for people, making the mortgage and getting medicine takes precedence. I don't think it should be legal for any of these things to happen, and certainly not robo-repeat calling but yet as you read these comments they are going on. I hope this has a good outcome and there will be laws and fines for those companies that do this, because what is available now, suing the debt collector, has not put a dent in their egregious behavior.
