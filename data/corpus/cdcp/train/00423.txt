More information to the consumer with the initial notification would be more confusing and intimidating than it already is for them. Simplifying the initial notification while including information about how to contact someone if you do not recognized this obligation is the way to go. Then the CFPB can design and require everyone to send a separate Summary of Consumer Rights to a consumer. It could also be available in the exact same form on the CFPB website and on informed professionals websites within the industry. I would maintain the consumer's right to ask for a cease communication, but I would suggest that the CFPB would serve everyone better by including that the CFPB would suggest that the consumer may be better served by keeping this communication available except as a last resort. This solution also bears the added advantage of making sure the public is aware of the assistance available through the CFPB.
