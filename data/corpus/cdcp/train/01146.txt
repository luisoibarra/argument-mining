I was flat out lied to by the attorney for a credit card company who brought a small claims suit against me. I disputed the debt (and still do even after they garnished my wagesbut they intimidated me into a payment arrangement then lied to me and said there was no court date anymore since I "settled".I was skeptical and called the clerk of court's office only to find out they liedand I did need to show up.I showed up for the court date, even as I argued that this court had no jurisdiction over me because I never lived in that countybut no-one even the clerk's office would listen to meand I was denied the right to go before a judge.I was only given an opportunity to talk to the attorney for the credit card company and sign papers saying we had a payment arrangement.Long story short, I made 1 of 2 payments then lost my job.I called them immediately to tell them I would make the 2nd and final payment 2-3 weeks late because I had to wait for a final check.They told me okay,but unbeknownst to me,they went back to court without me and got a default judgement for $1600 on what would have been a $709 payment.iI never got notice of the court hearing nor did I ever get a copy of the judgement.I didn't find out about it until I got a wage garnishment notice from my new employer 2 1/2 years later....VERY humiliating!My employer got the wage garnishment notice a week before I didso I couldn't even dispute it before my employer was involved.Second, I called the clerk of court's office in that county (3 hours from my home) and argued that you can't go to court without giving me a chance to defend myself and I shouldn't be forced to drive 3 hours each way to a county I never lived in.I was told by the clerk's office that they can file it wherever they want and I have to show up.I asked "So if they wanted to file this in California to be jerks you're telling me I'd have to get on a plane and fly to California to defend a $709 lawsuit""She said "Yes."THAT HAS TO CHANGE.
