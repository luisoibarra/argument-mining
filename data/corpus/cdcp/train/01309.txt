I have experience collection companies who buys the debt from the 1st 2nd or 3rd party add on its fees along with the other companies fees,then submit a new account number to the original account as though it was a new account. So, a original account for the sake of argument was $500.00 turns out to be listed on your credit report as a $3,000 delinquent account. Government laws should not allow this practice to exist. What ever the original account is that's what should be reported not interest and additional fees a collection company deems it can add to your credit bureau report.
