Probably won't find any legislation since people who have allegedly defaulted on a debt aren't necessarily going to tell the world, or create a lobby for their cause. Debt Defaults and Debt Collections are a one sided issue in which judges have been constrained to simply determine if a default has occurred, or not. The lawyers primarily work with strategic defaulters because S.D.'s have some source of money or income available to pay both the attorney and a partial portion of the debt. Involuntary Defaulters are left to fend for themselves because they don't have money to pay a lawyer. Debt Neutrality, in which an involuntary defaulter agrees they owe the debt and simply want's to be able to pay it down based on the amount the debt was at the time of the default, with no more penalties, interest rate charges, or fees, even if it takes 10 years to pay off the debt, would possibly alleviate a large amount of unnecessary court cases. And of course, once the very modest initial payments were set up, the account would no longer register as a negative on a debtor's credit score or credit rating. And to safeguard fraud, the debtor would not be able to keep borrowing larger and larger amounts of money until after their defaults were paid in full. It's a very logical solution in my opinion. Judges should be able to use logic to solve the growing backlog of credit card default cases.
