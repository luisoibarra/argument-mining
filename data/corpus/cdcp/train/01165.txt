Technology does not allow debtors or alleged debtors to distinguish land lines from cellphones of debt collectors; whether private or federal. There appears to be a double standard between the debtor and collector. I have received calls after business hours and sometimes even on a Sunday from a mortgage servicer, whom I will not disclose.
