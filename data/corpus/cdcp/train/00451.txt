Compliance 2013 demonstrates the type of arrogance that I have been addressing in my prior comments. The belief that a default is a default by courts along with the practice of REWARDING Strategic Defaulters while sentencing INVOLUNTARY DEFAULTERS to never ending escalating debt because of the ongoing interest rate charges needs to be addressed. I have been researching consumer debt for the past few years  and Consumer Debt is ON THE RISE GLOBALLY, and that is not a good thing. Canadian finance expert warns about rising consumer debt. __URL__ I can replace Canada in the title with England, Australia, South Africa, China, Russia, Ireland and on and on and on. The consumer debt escalation is being caused by a ridiculously low 2% monthly minimum payment, the gateway drug to higher and higher debt, and because consumers who have legitimate life Changing events that cause them to default cannot plead INVOLUNTARY DEFAULT in court. We let criminals plead involuntary to many crimes, but not law abiding citizens when it comes to their credit cards and student loans!
