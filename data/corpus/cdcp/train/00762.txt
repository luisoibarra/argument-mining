Several courts have held"and the [FTC] and the [CFPB] agree'that a collector who sues or threatens suit on a time-barred debt violates the FDCPA. The FDCPA prohibits, among other things, the use of "any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt."  These include making a false representation of 'the character, amount, or legal status of any debt," threatening 'to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken," and "using any false or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt." __URL__ It is in fact your gross distortion of the law and misunderstanding to claim that SOL are a defensive mechanism to allow a plaintiff "to avoid being disadvantaged" for not filing a lawful suit within a lawful time frame.
