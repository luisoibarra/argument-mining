I got hit with a notice from a doctor's office and his collection agency that I owed and -- get this -- never responded to their notices. First, I never got any notices  and second, I called the doctor's office and validated that I have never been a patient there. The office manager even wrote a letter to the collection agency. It was clearly THEIR mistake, The collection agency got all hot and bothered and rude to me because then they had to pay to remove the notice of me "owing" a debt from the three credit reporting agencies boy I hope you go after these cowboys next --  and yet it was removed. But while waiting for the letter, I managed to actually get someone on the phone from Equifax, I was so angry,  and their attitude was, "we just report this" blah blah blah. I say there ought to be sanctions, monetary sanctions, against these credit reporting agencies for making these mistakes and their cavalier attitude. They have this attitude of, so what? This has been more than two years ago and still seethe because of the cavalier and rude attitude when it was clearly their mistake. I even called MY eye doctor and had him write a letter that I was HIS patient. You think things don't get out of hand? YOu don't know how this kind of thing hurts people's ratings, scores whatever and then add insult to injury when you deal with rude inept people. Hit them in the pocketbook and you will see how fast they will make sure they do not make any mistakes.
