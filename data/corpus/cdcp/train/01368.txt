I don't believe that debt tolling should be legal. For instance, I had a medical crisis while living in Illinois for college. Despite having insurance, I still ended up deeply in debt. I attempted to work with the debt collectors,  but I just couldn't keep up due to the massive amounts. I moved back to Wisconsin where I'm from. The debt has since become time-barred in Wisconsin due to the statute of limitations. It's not on my credit report and I can't be sued for it here. However, should I ever wish to return to Illinois again, it's like I never left and I can be raked over the coals by debt collectors all over again, including being sued. This doesn't make any sense. Either I get sued or I don't. It's been over 10 years,  and it's not like I skipped the country and "hid" from them. I'd like to return to Illinois,  but doing so would kill my credit. They had 10 years to sue me. Isn't that enough? This is unfair  and I believe the issue of debt tolling should be explored. It's just not right.
