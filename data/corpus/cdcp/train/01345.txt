Student Loans, Many of the problems that students are facing are with student loans from the private sector. Take for example Sallie Mae, this company has it on file that i dod not graduate from college  and i did graduate. Their collections agencies are like loan sharks going to the extreme of making threats and cussing out students who cannot make payments. I know for some people it is easy to make payments on student loans  but for many it is a struggle to get by. All students are trying to better themselves  and sometimes they simply cannot afford to make payments. Companies like Sallie Mae are in the business of making peoples lives miserable. Their collection practices, customer service and lack of options are usually the reason why students default on their loans. Paying for college is a marathon not a sprint  and these companies treat the repayment of student loans like a sprint. I think they need to offer more options to students. I also think private institutions ala the schools that lend money to students need to do a better job at giving students options to prevent default. resolutions and remedy not judgement and default.
