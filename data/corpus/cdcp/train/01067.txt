I'm in the same situation--get calls about numerous people with my last name and one or the other of my two initials. None of the people being sought are even related to me, as far as I know, much less living with me. I would like to be able to make an official declaration that I have no delinquent debt and that I do not live with anyone who does. I'd be willing to renew the declaration once a year in order to stop receiving these calls that are nothing more than fishing expeditions.
