What I had in mind when I made this comment was that some debtors are in debt because of a medical condition that has negatively impacted their ability to work. They may be on Social Security disability for this reason. Sometimes, that medical condition is scientifically known to be aggravated by stress, such as any heart condition, or an anxiety disorder. Currently, Section 806 of the FDCPA makes abuse or harassment of debtors illegal. However, what qualifies as abuse might be different for a debtor with a disabling medical condition that is sensitive to stress. My hope, and my suggestion, is that there could be some way for debtors to make collection agencies aware of the fact that the debtor has a documented medical disability, and that abusive or harassing phone calls have additional health consequences for the debtor.
