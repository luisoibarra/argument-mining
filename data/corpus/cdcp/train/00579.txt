I think there should be a fed law that should clearly state that any partial payment might revive the SOL for suit. How consumers get a phone call/letter telling them they have a debt and they just blindly pay it or make partial payments in order to just stop getting the phone calls? Lots. And the debt might not even be theirs,  but they pay it anyways thinking that they might have a old debt that they forgot to take care of. The problem with that is, that the debt then is revived, the debt collector sues, and the judge tells the debtor "well, if this wasn't your debt then why did you agree to make partial payments?" Then the judge will make favor in the debt collector for a revived debt that the debtor was not even responsible for in the first place. This scenario happens every day of the week. And the consumer had thought they were doing the right thing, but the debt collector is actually taking advantage.
