I have no personal experiences with debt to speak of, only my experiences working with victims of identity theft who have fraudulent debts; which is a horse of a different color. Consumers are not educated about how debt collection and revival works. The issue in the end isn't the mechanics, or if they can request the debt not be reported. The issue is that, the way things stand now, it is not clear how repaying a debt will improve their score. It is not clear that they can ask for the collector not to report the debt payment if the debt is older than seven years. Consumers are confused and have these inaccurate perceptions because things are not clear. Again, it is the perception which concerns me - it would benefit both creditors and consumers if it was plain and clear, in language the average consumer could understand, that paying off a debt is a good thing.
