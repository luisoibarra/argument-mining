Someone who lived at my address, more than 30 years ago had a debt with Household Finance. We get letters that we return "Addressee Unknown" and phone calls. Finally I called one number back and told them that the person they looked for wasn't there. That law firm stopped robo-calling  but a few months later a new one started up. Records should convey when debts are sold from collection agency to collection agency. Why should I have to go through all that a second time? I also think debt collectors should be prohibited from using the address to get a phone number after 2 years. This debt was more than 30 years old why do they think anyone who knew here would still live there? I googled the woman's name. I found out on the first search that she lives about 10 miles from here. If I can find her that easily why can't a debt collector, who stands to gain something, be bothered to do a little research?
