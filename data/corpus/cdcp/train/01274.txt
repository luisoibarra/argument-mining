I would take a hard look at 'credit reporting' from what is being reported by a creditor and then what is reported by a debt collection or debt buying company. For example, if a creditor obtains a judgment amount greater than the account balance, that amount is likely not reported  because creditors seldom have system capabilities to make adjustments to accounts.
