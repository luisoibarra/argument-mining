I knew a man who was sued by a debt collector and he was not served. "Someone" was served, but not at his address and he was denied due process. He learned of the suit when it was a judgment on his credit report. He attempted to have the judgment overturned for lack of due process and the judge would not grant it. Unfortunate, but yes they are allowed to deny due process and get away with it.
