As I frequent many of the consumer credit forums, I will tell you that most consumers do think that a debt can still be brought to court when the receive contact past the SOL. And others I have run into also still get contacted even after the 7 year mark when the debt has finally dropped from their credit report. In fact, just the debt dropping off from the reports that has otherwise been dormant will get an automatic response from debt collectors. It seems they purposely wait for it to drop off and then pounce to instill fear. As in a "gentle" reminder that they are still there. They act like sharks in the water circling their prey. And the consumers bring up questions like "when will this end?" and "I thought the debt wipes out after 7 years, why are they still contacting me?" Something needs to be done about this. SOL are SOL for a reason. Debt collectors should not be able to harass and harass and harass.
