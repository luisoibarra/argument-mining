The first entity I will probably take to small claims court and possibly file a complaint with Kamala Harris. The second incident I started sending faxes messages in big bold letters to the same fax where my prior faxes had been lost, asking other workers to look to see if they had taken the papers by accident. I also faxed overnight warning those who might have access to that room that taking fax documents could lead to their arrest. I did this for several days in a row. It was the only way I could think of to apply a much needed enema to those who have established a routine and can't shake free from it. Of course this assumes that they care.
