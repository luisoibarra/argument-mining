I don't think that the partial SSN should be included. That raises too many privacy concerns. And I'm sure that one day a debt collection company will have a "system malfunction" and will "accidentally" send the full SSN. Too many consumers have similar names in the same city. Lastly, many different companies classify a partial SSN as the first 5 digits whereas other stick to the traditional last 4 digits. If a mail thief is lurking, then he might have access to a consumers full SSN.
