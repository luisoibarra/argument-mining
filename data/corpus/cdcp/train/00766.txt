After offering documentation that I didn't owe a debt, the collection company ignored what I offered as proof and continued to try to collect the debt even stated they didn't care that I didn't owe it. They should be required to investigate and respond in writing to a consumer's defense, so a follow up can be made, or complaint filed with a governmental agency. Documentation should also follow the claim  as collection companies sell their lists to new companies. Better, no documented defense of a claim should be eligible for sale until resolved.
