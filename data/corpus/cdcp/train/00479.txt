As a bankruptcy lawyer, I frequently deal with clients or are harassed by debt collectors calling family or neighbors. the collectors will claim they are acquiring location information, but this is frequently the case where the consumer has been at the same location for years. I hope the rules will narrow the "location information" exception  so that it can only be used where there is really doubt about the consumer's location.
