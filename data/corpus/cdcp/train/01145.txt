Yes, I do think your restrictions on workplace calls per week would be helpful, but I do not see any information requiring details on the content of Robo-Calls.  For example, the calls I referred to earlier included robo-calls telling me that I had "messages" waiting for me in my Bayview Account, and to access these messages, I needed to call a special phone number. Well, this was a bunch of baloney it was just a recording wanting to know where I had sent my mortgage payment I had not set up an electronic deposit yet, like they wanted, so they assumed I was skipping a payment). I believe those robo-calls were fraudulent and misleading, particularly since I was never late on any payments,  and I never had any "message" waiting for me. Just a robotic collection message. I received three of these messages and they are still saved in my cell phone voice mail.
