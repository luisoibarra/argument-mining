Collection Agency's' should be REQUIRED by law to show their phone number when calling a debtor. Most if not all come up "unknown". If they are a legitimate company then they should have no problem showing their number. If I call them, and my number is blocked, I can't get thru until I unblock my number. If they truly are legitimate, they should want to do things fair and above board.
