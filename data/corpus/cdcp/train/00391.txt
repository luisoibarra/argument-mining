The price of paper (bad debt) varies depending on the collectability of the debt based on info known about the debtor and also varies based on the amount of documentation purchased from the original creditor. Most debt buyers only pay for a couple of recent credit card statements. They may provide a "bill of sale" but these never identify a specific account being sold and reference a master purchase contract which is never provided.
