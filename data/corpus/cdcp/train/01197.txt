When calling about a debt, debt collectors MUST verify that they are speaking to the debtor(s) or other adult within the household. I know that is stated within the FDCPA but from experience I know it doesn't always happen. My situation goes back to the 1970's but it was done then  and it's probably still being done today. Calling repeatedly, threatening, screaming, cursing at children gets collectors absolutely nowhere. It is a most disgusting form of abuse that should never be tolerated. New language in the FDCPA should specifically and clearly state this. Additionally, there should be some form of penalty for collectors who engage in this demeaning and useless practice.
