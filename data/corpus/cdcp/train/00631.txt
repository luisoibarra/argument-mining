The courts should also mandate that if a debtor has reached out to the creditor in an attempt to negotiate the creditor must continue to try to reach a settlement rather than seeking judgment against the debtor. Also, the collection agency should not be able to add interest on top of debt that seek judgment for if the debtor agrees to pay  since they will make a profit over what they paid the original creditor. Basically these so called "attorneys" (just another form of ambulance chaser in my book) are just forcing bankruptcies upon people who would be willing to work a deal  and then they and the courts and the government are whining about what the bankruptcies do to the economy and the bottom line. Last time I checked even in a court of law you can't play both sides.
