Get a copy of the police report and mail it to all three.They HAVE to put a freeze on your report, and you get a pin, and if you have to lift it you need to have that pin.It is quite a pain.I had a burglary in 2012 -- 14 pages of items stolen, I had to call all my credit cards and get issued new ones.Heartbreaking --not just things like my computer, but items of great value, and great sentimental value.The least you should have is the peace of mind of having a freeze on your report.And they HAVE to do it.Otherwise, go to a lawyer and let them dangle on the end of the meat hook.It is a pain, but worth doing.
