My experience has been that people younger than I (a boomer) prefer to communicate electronically (emails, texts & chats). I know that when I was deeply in debt, I would have preferred not to have to speak to a real person. There is a legitimate concern about unencrypted email or the potential for consumers not to consider that others may have access to their email. However, in general, we should encourage communication, however that happens - especially if it is in a form preferred by a particular consumer. I believe that emails, chats & texts should all be considered writings. I don't know how you include all disclosures unless you direct someone to a place where they can read them in plain english.
