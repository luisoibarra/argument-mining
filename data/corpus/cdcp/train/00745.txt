My deceased daughter(she passed 2 years ago) had some debt. We continue to receive calls from debt collectors even after we have asked them not to call us anymore. My wife has filed complaints with the Oregon State Justice dept. to complain about the harrassment. Why can't these collectors do their research on the debtor, before they harrass the parents!!
