I had the same situation with another cellular carrier. It seems it's a ploy to keep making the debt seem fresh. It was another early termination fee, and I wrote many letters before it was finally removed from my credit report. I think that the tactic of selling the same debt to keep it on a credit report definitely should stop. It is one debt, and there is a time limit for how long it stays on one's credit report. One way to keep track of this is to require people to be notified if a debt is sold. It is required when a mortgage is sold. It seems like a no-brainer. The rules should also be written to discourage -- no, to bar -- collections companies from passing around debt for the purpose of keeping it on credit reports.
