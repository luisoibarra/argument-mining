I am saying that collection agencies cannot be trusted and more often than not go beyond their job scope. Some act as loan sharks and not collection agencies. I also think that their behavior is criminal when it comes to making threats against consumers and harassing people with disabilities and seniors. So, yes i think criminal charges should be pursued for their cover ups and harassment. Also other violations of privacy and fairness.
