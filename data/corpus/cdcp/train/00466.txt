I am concerned that state and federal agencies are contributing to identity theft, big time. In just the past month I had to make an online payment on what I believe was a federal hobbs act violation by the Los Angeles building and Safety department. A day after making the payment or risk losing my home, that same credit card was being used online by thieves. Then a few weeks later another agency asked for bank documents, I supplied them via fax, and they were lost! And on top of that, there really didn't seem to be a big deal made out of the fact that the documents went missing.
