The reason they can sell it for a fraction of what is owed is because the debt buyer is purchasing entire portfolios of bad debt. It spreads out the risk. If you can get a million other delinquent consumers to go in with you on a 10% offer, you could probably get them to take it. But it doesn't make financial sense for them to offer the same transaction to you as the debt buyer.
