The current validation notice is already too long--bordering on "boilerplate". To add more language to this would confuse or intimidate the least sophisticated debtor and/or lead them to immediately ask that the creditor cease communication. The problem with that strategy is that it forces the creditor to file suit, thereby incurring court costs that will be added to the debt. Instead, debtors should be encouraged to communicate their questions & concerns to the collector who can then (after right-party verification) openly discuss the account & quite possibly answer the debtor's question(s).
