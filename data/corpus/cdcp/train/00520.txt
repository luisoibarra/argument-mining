After having a perfect payment history for 15 years, I had to across the board default on six accounts because I became an unpaid caregiver for my parents.However, before I ever defaulted, I contacted each account and explained what was going on.I would also like to note that five of the six accounts were still being paid down until I ran out of savings.I discovered the credit card companies HAVE NO INTAKE for potential defaulters.I consider a potential default division a cost of doing business that credit card companies have eschewed because they have co-opted the courts to do all the work for them for a very nominal fee.My goal was simple, keep making monthly miniscule autopay payments on all six accounts in exchange for no harrassing phone calls so that I could concentrate on CareGiving AND modifying my self employment so that I could make something every month.Everyone refused, and the harrassing and MORE IMPORTANTLY REPETITIVE phone calls started.I ended up having to convert my land lines to 6 dollar a month cell phones, and then I rarely used them because I could not afford the 20 cents a minute cost.In essence the credit card companies and debt collectors destroyed the best way I had to regenerate earnings while still being an unpaid CareGiver.And as Marlene so eloquently pointed out, an additional roadblock is the debt collectors ABSOLUTE REFUSAL to put any verbal agreement reached in writing!
