I think limitation is good as not to harass. I think it has been generally defined as 3-4 days per day,  though I think that is still excessive,  and any collector who follows that is clearly trying to harass. Who else would someone call 3-4 times in a day? But, with the example of 1 call per day, I would think that there would also need to be another limitation such as 1 call per day or no more than 4 calls in a week. Otherwise, a collector could call 1 time a day, 7 times a week, 30 times in a month, etc. And personally, in my personal phone calls and in my business phone calls, it can take me more than a day or two to return a message. Customarily, in personal phone calls and business phone calls, if a message is left, the caller will leave a message and wait a couple of days before calling back if the person has yet to return the phone call. This is the way normal phone etiquette works--both in personal phone calls and in business calls. So, why should debt collections be different, why should they break the norms.
