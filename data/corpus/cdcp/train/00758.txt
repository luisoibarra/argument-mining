For attorney debt collectors, being required to provide a list of all the rights the consumer may have comes perilously close to the provision of legal advice; even if it doesn't cross that line, the unsophisticated debtor may believe that an attorney is acting as a neutral court officer rather than as an advocate for an adverse party. I've had debtors ask me "Do I need to come to court for this?" after I've sued them.
