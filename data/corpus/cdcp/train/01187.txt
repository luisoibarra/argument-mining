I have a charged off debt I want to pay off. I cannot afford a lump sum and asked the debt collector and original lender in writing mutiple times to work with me on a settlement. They refuse to answer my letters and I keep writing every month. I think they should be made to at least respond to a customer requests for repayment. They keep asking for my employer name and bank account number because I know they want to use it to garnish my wages and bank account. Of course I do not have $32k to settle. It was a 2nd mtg, I lost home due to loss of job, they refused to modify because they said investor wanted to foreclose instead.
