I too am a family member of a consumer who claims to have paid his debt of 12 - 15 years ago, but my husband and I receive two or three calls a day asking for him to call various agencies about a "matter" with a case #.In one instance they said they would be at the door in one hour.This family member has not lived here for about 16 years.They should not be allowed to call anyone other than the debtor who nowadays can be found on the internet!!!
