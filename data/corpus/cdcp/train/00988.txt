You are a liar! I have been harassed for over 5 years by companies looking for someone I have never heard of  because this person put a random string of our area code, local exchange and 4 numbers together (that turned out to be my number) on a loan that he then defaulted on. I have told them to stop calling, they have a wrong number, and guess what" 5 Years later, they are still calling!
