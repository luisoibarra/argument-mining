You are not living in the real world if you think it is just so easy, RBell. No, most consumers are not lawyers. The people using these debt collection practices are deliberately abusing the law  because they know most who are harassed and in debt and working people who probably can't afford a lawyer. And I'll just bet it is worst in the states with the least amount of consumer protection. Take care. You will sing a different tune when it is you on the meat hook.
