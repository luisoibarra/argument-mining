Too many collectors call and never report the "mini-Miranda warning". They call all times of the day and night, and multiple times of the day. If they don't get you because your have called ID, they will change their ID and try again. It is simply harrassment. Many will challenge the the consumer, threaten, and even harrass them to the point that I saw someone actually contemplate suicide. Also, when a debt is sold, the information for the orginal details need to go with it. many times these collectors will call,  and they have no details on debts that are 5 and 6 years old,  and the consumer doesn't rememer it.
