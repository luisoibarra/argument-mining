It apprears that the debt collectors of the debt collection industry are conducting a money laundry and racketing operation by explointing and obtaining monetary from comsumers for products that they don't sell to them or services that they don't provide to consumers with no inital purchase contract with consumers. It appears that debt collectors are obtaining monetary from consumers where they don't have licenses to sell products to consumers or provide services to consumers. It appears that debt collectors are costing companies money when companies are trying to recover their loses when they miss payments from their customers for the products that they sell to their customers or the services that they provide to their customers with alegal purchase contracts. It seems that debt collector are relying on companies' money and on consumers' money for an income when they are not initially involved in the a company sale of products to consumers or in the distributing of a company of services to a consumers.
