I agree with anoymousme, I am constantly called up to 5 times a day by numerous collectors for my kids bills. Why should we have to bothered. I gave my kids the message  but they ignore it. They do not have a land line  so they call me!!!On NEWYEARS  I am dropping my land line which I have had for 40 years just to be rid of these pests! How long are parents responsible for deadbeat children.
