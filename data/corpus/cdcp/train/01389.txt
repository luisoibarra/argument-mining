This is the problem. What account would stay open for 20 years after being delinquent. It seems to me this is just a way to prolong as long as possible the ability to harass people for very old debt. There needs to be time limits. This type of thing, re-filing debt, selling the same debt to someone else, and then adding it back AGAIN to the credit report is just an excuse to harass the heck out of people and do it legally. These are not good business practices. This is harassment. Once a debt is placed on a credit report -- or even sooner -- once the debt letter is sent, time should start running and this agency needs to set time limits that are reasonable. Creditors have a right to try to collect true, accurate debt. But what happens is the debt is wildly inflated, then it runs the gamut of various collection agencies until nobody even remembers its genesis. This is all to harass.
