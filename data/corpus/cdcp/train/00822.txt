I was sued for an alleged debt from 1993 by NYC landlord. Judge denied him the 1600. and then his real estate/collections attorney put me into collections  and the landlord got to write off a debt that was not a debt. Great for these big landlords in NYC  as they play the corporate game and sue a tenant 10 times and write it off each and every time even though its not a valid debt. Its a big deal in Manhattan.
