I have seen the "moderator" in the caller ID forum ask if it would be okay to put the company's name on the caller ID because this could show to others around that the person has a debt and would then compromise the consumer's privacy and security. Yet, there is a discussion to allow these calls at a consumer's work? many people do not work in an office, so a message would have to be left with a secretary. This is letting someone else know of a debt who should not be privy to that information. The ONLY reason these companies have to calling someone at work is to publicly shame the person into paying. It is the modern version of putting someone in stockades and throwing fruit at them, or a modern scarlet letter. If there is another phone number on an application, that is the one that needs to be used. If there is an address on the application, that is what needs to be used. Calls to someone's work are off limits PERIOD! There is not way for the collection agency or the government regulation body to GUARANTEE that no one besides the consumer gets the information when someone's work is called.
