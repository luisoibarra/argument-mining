By the time a file reaches litigation, the debtor has already received at least one prior opportunity to resolve the debt with the collector (the initial demand letter, which by law must inform the debtor of his/her right to challenge the veracity of the debt being pursued). By making default judgment more difficult, the CFPB would only be rewarding the debtors who choose to take no action to resolve their complaints. Furthermore, the CFPB arguably has no authority to impose new, more burdensome requirements upon litigants in state court fora. Doing so would constitute an admission that state court rules of civil procedure deny due process in other types of proceedings that are not granted the "benefit" of Federal oversight.
