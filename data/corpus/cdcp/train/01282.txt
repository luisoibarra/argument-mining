They will just continue to call. Not answering does not stop the constant calls. They need to be required to identify themselves accurately  so the consumer has at least a fighting chance to speak with them. In my case I have no debts of my own but am constantly harassed for other people's debts  because I have a fairly common last name. They just start calling everyone with the same last name as their actual debtor.
