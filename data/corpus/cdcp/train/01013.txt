I recommend that the option to bring a suit in the jurisdiction where the consumer signed the contract should be removed. In many situations, consumers may not actually sign a contract (e.g. credit cards), they may sign an agreement in a distant location (for medical payment at a hospital on vacation),  or they may have moved in the years since opening the account. I believe the most consumer-friendly option is to file suit where the consumer resides at time of commencement (unless it concerns real property and then it should be where the property is located). With respect to geographic size concerns, it is important to note that many states are facing budget crises that affect the civil divisions of state courts. In one of our largest districts, our options for filing suit was reduced from 32 courts down to 2. If there is a concern for protecting consumers in this particular area, I recommend a section of the rule that prohibits collections from choosing a court venue with the intention of interfering with the consumer's ability to participate in the action. To prove a violation, the consumer (or regulatory agency) would need to demonstrate that the collector had no reason to file suit in that court other than burdening the consumer (thus demonstrating intent).
