Just to make my comment clear: I implied that the Free-to-end-user alternatives (if allowed to be used) need to be regulated so that they are not selling phone numbers and compromising the privacy of the consumers.My comment made it appear as though I think that the free texting apps (which allow people to text for free) and the free-to-end-user alternatives are the same thing.They are not.I don't want the free-to-end-user alternatives to behave the same as free texting apps -- selling phone numbers to Spammers.
