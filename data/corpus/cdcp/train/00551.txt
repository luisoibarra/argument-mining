As a debt collector, I noticed a problem with the protection of landlords/property owners who are requesting internal DNC's with the company I have employment with. As they will be Do not call flagged "DNC" with one account, they will not be DNC'ed with another account for the purposes of skip tracing, the chance of repeat calls in urban centers harassing certain members of the public is plausible  as the only numbers that are held consistently in the database afaik "By Law" are verified and confirmed numbers.
