A central system has privacy concerns and it would be useful only if it included verification of who picked up the document and when. Instead creditors and debt buyers should be mandated to allow secure document uploading to their own website with official notification that the document has been reviewed. I have a pending case of a company misapplying my payments, I had to send many registered letters and faxes with proof of payment which cost some money and time. With this company anything you send them "doesn't exist" unless you have verifiable proof they have been forced to accept it. It would be a lot easier for the consumers to just upload the documentation and get verification the company reviewed it which can be used for a complaint. There should be penalties of fines for not marking an uploaded document as "reviewed" after a period of time.
