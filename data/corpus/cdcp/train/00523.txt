Once I tell a debt collector I am a unpaid CareGiver and that is why I had to stop making payments, In essence they were telling me to let my parents die if necessary and go get a job. I was repeatedly baited with the comment, "So you are a "refuse to pay". I found this type of conduct outside the lines of common decency. I had a business, I had to give up the business to become an unpaid CareGiver. If I had been shown at the time I apparently agreed to the credit card agreement that there truly were no ifs ands or buts in regards to monthly payments forgiveness on an "unsecured" debt, I would have come up with a different business model that did not require credit card debt. Credit card companies get to present themselves as pro family in their advertising when the exact opposite is true in times of crisis. Ask people who had a dramatic life changing incident occur how the credit card companies treated them. Ask the Colorado flood victims, or the Hurricane Sandy Victims, or the person who was the victim of a hit and run how the credit card companies treated them. These are the same credit card companies that lobbied the comptroller of the currency in 2002 to keep their monopoly on credit card debt suspension insurance and the outrageous overpriced premiums they were charging their customers. One of the best ways consumers had to be responsible regarding their credit card debts was having AFFORDABLE credit card debt suspension insurance. This option was stolen from consumers in 2002 when the comptroller of the currency allowed credit card companies to over charge by 1000% to 2000% on monthly credit card debt suspension insurance premiums. I created a time line document that shows how the financial elite stole fairness from the people in regards to credit card products. My appearance in front of the CFPB in May of 2013 and the research I shared with them. __URL__
