I think the requirement for a debt collector to send a validation notice 5 days after the initial contact is backwards. I believe communication between the debtor and debt collector would be improved if the debtor has the validation notice before the initial telephone contact. The debt collector should be required to mail the debtor a validation notice 5 days before any phone contact, not 5 days after. Otherwise, the debtor is speaking with an unknown caller, who has surprised them with a demand for money. The debtor has not been provided with any time to prepare their thoughts, or to formulate important questions about the alleged debt. They may be caught "off guard", increasing the fear and anxiety of the debtor, which would necessarily lead to impaired verbal communication. The debtor has no written factual statement to refer to during the phone call, while the debt collector has all of the factual details in from of them on their computer screen, and can cite facts and figures. This situation creates an imbalance of power not conducive to good communication. This proposal to require debt collectors to send a validation notice 5 days before the first telephone contact would impose no financial burden on the debt collector,  because validation notices are already required to be sent to the debtor. It is simply a change in the timing of an already existing requirement.
