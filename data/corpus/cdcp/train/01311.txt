In my opinion,collection companies,credit bureaus, and every one in between should be made to have some type of soft ware that could identify time-barred debt.Plus, regulation that will not allow creditors/buyers to reactivate an old debt. If a given state has its own statue of limitation regarding a legitimate time line to collect a debt, so be it. The Validation Notice,should identify the true facts of the debt in question. After complete due process has been exhausted, the record should be completely removed from the consumer file.
