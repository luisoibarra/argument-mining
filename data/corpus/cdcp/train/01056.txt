In order to get a default judgment through a State Court, a collector's pleadings have to spell out the theory of their case (usually contract) with sufficient specificity that a reasonable person can understand the basis for the claim. Without some form of affidavit from the actual creditor, very few courts will award a default judgment. Also, most state court approved forms are already written for the "least sophisticated debtor." I don't see any reason to impose a more stringent standard on collection lawsuits than are imposed on any other lawsuit.
