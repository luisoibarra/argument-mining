I have one debt in the court. Here is my issue, I never received any paperwork saying there was a court date. I did receive a letter from my bank a month after the court hearing saying they received a garnishment notice. They could've saved the court costs since I already had told them I was unemployed. Secondly, after I received the bank letter, I then received three (that's right three) garnishment hearing notices from three different companies for the same debt. Since I was unemployed I could not afford to get an attorney. It would've been nice if I could have provided the court (telephonically or by pre-trial documents) with documentation to explain why I was unable to pay the debt,  but the paperwork said to only respond if you did not owe the debt. I believe court documents and debt companies should have easier and clearer paperwork for the lay person to understand their rights. And yes, debt collectors should have to provide documentation that the debt is owed and they have the right to collect.
