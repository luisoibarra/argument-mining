Keep in mind, a cease and desist letter does not stop a debt collector from attempting to collect a debt, it only stops the debt collector from communicating with the consumer via whatever method the consumer requests the contact to stop. This does not mean a consumer no longer owes a debt. I do agree with the fact that a debt collector must notify the creditor of disputes. As a matter of fact, legitimate debt collectors do this on a regular basis. As a debt collector typically does not own the debt, they're unable to control what a creditor does with that information, all they are currently able to do is implement internal controls that protect the consumer and the agency. In my opinion, a legitimate dispute should be defined  as currently, a consumer solely mentioning the word dispute requires action on an account. I believe some sort of requirement should be imposed as to WHY an account is being disputed and some sort of evidence be provided to support the claim.
