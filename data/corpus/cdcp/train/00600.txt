I am on a Senior plan for my mobile phone and I get charged for each text that comes in or goes out.I am able to make/receive texts, but have to pay for each one ...so it is not fair to make me pay extra on top of what I already owe.I am against using cell phones for business advertisements or debt collecting texts or calls.
